									<div class="row">
										<div class="section colour1 col-12">
											<p><b>Review of IT Code of Conduct</b></p>
											<p><b>Key Documents</b></p>
											<p>The document "Communication: Data protection rules as a trust-enabler in the EU and beyond – taking stock" (European Commission, 2019) talks about the critical role of data protection in forming trust among individuals, businesses and public authorities. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 2016) outlines data protection laws for the European Union. It establishes the right of individuals regarding personal data. It should be noted that UK organisations no longer need to comply with these documents but with the UK versions of them.</p>
											
											<p> I reviewed the established Code of Conduct for a Sixth Form College in the UK. There is a core Code of Conduct document that is supported by individual documents covering, such as the Internet Acceptable Use Policy, the Setting Passwords Protocol, and the BYOD to Work Policy.</p>
											
											<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
											<p>The Data Protection Policy follows the GDPR(UK) and lays out the responsibilities for protecting personal data. A lot of student and teacher data is held, and this document is clear but comprehensive, including procedures for data access requests and a data retention schedule. The Internet Acceptable Use Policy defines what is reasonable behaviour and what actions could compromise the network. This is an important document as it not only applies to teachers but also to students.</p>
											
											<p><b>Areas for Improvement</b></p>
											<p>When conducting this research, I found that each of the policies and procedures were b but found it difficult 
to locate them. They are all stored in one folder with all the other college policy documents. A unified Code of Conduct 
document could improve comprehension of the subjects and therefore compliance. However, retaining separate documents can 
allow for more detail to be included for each.</p>
											
											<p><b>Incident Reflection</b></p>
											<p>Recently the sixth form conducted a simulated phishing attack to see the actions of staff. Many staff opened the email and read it, and many opened the attachment that asked for a username and password. The exercise highlighted the need for ongoing staff education and clear reporting protocols.</p>
											
											<p><b>Future Implications</b></p>
											<p>The sixth form is currently going through the process of gaining Cyber Essentials Certification (National Cyber Security Centre, N.D.) and are currently in the data collection phase. We could also establish cyber security training for new and current staff to highlight the documents and where to find them, giving key details. There was also no formal incident response plan except to tell IT support.</p>

											<p>Hi Tim,</p>

											<p>Your review of the IT Code of Conduct for the Sixth Form College highlights some critical aspects of data protection and cybersecurity. It's great to see the college's commitment to following established policies like the Data Protection Policy and Internet Acceptable Use Policy. However, I agree that the difficulty in locating these documents suggests a need for improvement. A unified Code of Conduct could enhance understanding and compliance among staff and students.</p>

											<p>The simulated phishing attack you mentioned underscores the importance of ongoing education and clear reporting protocols. It’s a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities we face, particularly in an educational setting. As the college pursues Cyber Essentials Certification, I believe formal incident response plans and comprehensive cybersecurity training will be vital. This will not only reinforce existing policies but also ensure everyone knows how to access them, fostering a stronger culture of cybersecurity awareness.</p>

											<p>Thanks for sharing these insights!</p>

											<p>An example of an organisation's IT Code of Conduct can be seen in the policies of Amazon. Amazon places a strong emphasis on data protection and compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 2018). Their IT Code of Conduct outlines specific data handling practices that prioritise accountability, transparency, and lawful data processing (Vander Maelen, 2023). For instance, employees are required to follow stringent guidelines on collecting, using, storing, and deleting personal data, ensuring that only data necessary for business purposes is retained, in line with GDPR’s principles of data minimisation (European Commission, 2019).</p>

											<p>Furthermore, Amazon restricts access to personal data to authorised personnel based on job responsibilities, enforcing secure login protocols that include multi-factor authentication to prevent unauthorised access. The organisation also mandates encryption of all personal data, both in transit and at rest, to protect data integrity and confidentiality (Delgado-von-Eitzen et al., 2021). In case of any data breaches or security incidents, employees are instructed to report them immediately to the IT department, adhering to GDPR’s requirement for timely breach notifications.</p>

											<p>Moreover, Amazon conducts regular training sessions to educate employees about data protection laws, cyber threats, and secure data handling practices, reinforcing their roles in maintaining compliance (British Computing Society, 2022). By implementing such comprehensive measures, Amazon demonstrates its commitment to data security and user trust, effectively aligning its IT practices with GDPR standards.</p>

You’ve broken down the concepts clearly, making the topic accessible and easy to follow. I think the analysis could be enhanced by considering how Amazon’s policies are impacted by global markets, given that the company operates in many countries with their own legal requirements. Exploring how Amazon adapts its practices to comply with different laws would add valuable depth.</p>

											<p>Your research effectively highlights Amazon’s commitment to storing only the data that is necessary and using secure protocols. Additionally, the section on employee training shows that Amazon recognises the importance of equipping its staff with the knowledge and skills needed to uphold these policies.</p>

											<p>Overall, your work provides a clear and insightful analysis of Amazon’s approach to data protection, supported by well chosen examples and a strong focus on the critical role of employee training.</p>

											<p>Microsoft's IT Code of Conduct reflects a comprehensive approach to data protection and compliance, which is intended to uphold GDPR standards and foster trust in data handling processes. According to the European Commission's COM(2019), GDPR is a "trust-enabler" for both businesses and users within and outside of the EU, promoting practices that emphasize accountability, lawful processing, and data minimization (European Commission, 2019). These principles are embedded in Microsoft policies that guide employees on how to collect, store, and use data securely while remaining GDPR compliant. Enhancing GDPR training for employees could help to achieve these goals by raising awareness about data protection and compliance.</p> 

											<p>The Microsoft Trust Center describes the company's commitment to GDPR-compliant data handling, with an emphasis on transparency and secure processing standards (Microsoft, 2024). The Code of Conduct requires controlled access to sensitive data, with permissions restricted based on job responsibilities, to ensure that only authorized employees have access to personal information. Additionally, the organization enforces stringent security protocols for data in transit and at rest, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. These practices are closely aligned with GDPR standards for user privacy and secure processing. </p>

											<p>A recent issue with a CrowdStrike software update that caused Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crashes across industries highlights the importance of strong data protection protocols. This incident affected millions around the world, disrupting systems in industries such as healthcare and transportation (Zoysa, 2024). During this event, I was responsible for guiding customers through troubleshooting processes while maintaining data security as a top priority. This experience demonstrated the critical need for secure data management solutions, particularly in cloud environments, to prevent data loss or unauthorized access during technical issues.</p>

											<p>To improve resilience against similar incidents in the future, sensitive data should be handled exclusively within designated, GDPR-compliant platforms such as Microsoft's CRM. Furthermore, implementing regular audits by a dedicated security team could improve data protection efforts by ensuring that Microsoft's data handling practices remain GDPR-compliant and resilient to potential security risks.</p>

											<p>Your fellow colleague pursuing an MSc in Computer Science and currently working as a Software Engineer at Digital Processing Systems (DPS). My role involves developing robust solutions for automating repetitive tasks and implementing data ETL methodologies in automation processes. In this post, I reflect on Data Protection and IT Code of Conduct, focusing on how DPS aligns with GDPR principles. By examining DPS’s IT policies, I will highlight best practices, identify areas for improvement, and share lessons learned from real-world incidents involving data protection.</p>
											<p>Best Practices
											The Information Security Policy of DPS exemplifies several GDPR-compliant practices:
											<ol>
												<li>Confidentiality and Access Control: Information is protected against unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality (DPS, 2015).</li>
												<li>Incident Reporting: Breaches and suspected vulnerabilities are promptly reported and investigated, aligning with GDPR Article 33.</li>
												<li>Risk Assessment: Regular risk assessments identify and mitigate potential security failures, supporting GDPR’s accountability principle.</li>

											</ol>

											Additionally, the IT Service Management Policy emphasizes service continuity and availability management, which is critical for maintaining data availability as mandated by GDPR Article 32.</p>

											<p>Areas for Improvement
											While DPS has a robust policy framework, the following areas could be enhanced:

											<ol>
												<li>Employee Training: Training programs on GDPR compliance are not explicitly outlined. Frequent, targeted training can reinforce the importance of protecting personal and sensitive data.</li>
												<li>Data Retention Clarity: The retention policy for sensitive information needs greater transparency to comply with GDPR's storage limitation principle (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Article 5).</li>
												<li>Vendor Oversight: Although secure information sharing is highlighted, stronger contractual obligations for third-party compliance could minimize risks.</li>
											</ol></p>
											
											
											<p>Incident Reflection
											An incident occurred involving unauthorized access to sensitive client information due to inadequate access control policies. The specific scenario involved files from a client being scanned by designated personnel at DPS. After scanning, the files were stored on a shared storage system accessible by the scanning team, which posed a risk of unauthorized access.	</p>
												
												<p>Fortunately, the issue was mitigated before any harm occurred. As part of the mitigation process, I contributed by:
												<ol>
												
													<li>Developing automated scripts to move files from a folder accessible by the scanning team to a highly restricted folder. These scripts ensured secure and complete transfer while eliminating traces from the original folder.</li>
													<li>Adding a User Access Control (UAC) prompt for accessing the restricted folder, requiring specific credentials.</li>
													<li>Implementing Active Directory Policies to restrict folder access to a pre-approved list of users as agreed upon with the client.</li>
												</ol>
												</p>
											
											<p>Recommendations

											To prevent similar incidents and strengthen overall compliance:

												<ol>
													<li>Conduct regular training sessions for employees on GDPR compliance and emerging data security threats.</li>
													<li>Enforce a clear and transparent data retention policy to avoid unnecessary storage of sensitive information.</li>
													<li>Integrate Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools to monitor and secure sensitive data transfers.</li>
													<li>Strengthen vendor contracts with specific clauses to ensure third-party compliance with GDPR principles.</li>
												</ol>
											
											DPS's policies demonstrate a commitment to data security, reflecting GDPR principles and fostering trust. By addressing the identified gaps and adopting a proactive approach, DPS can further enhance its compliance framework and ethical practices in computing.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-1"></div>
										<div class="section colour2 col-11">
											<p>I found your analysis of Digital Processing Systems’ (DPS) Code of Conduct both interesting and insightful. You clearly showed how the existing policies align with key GDPR principles such as confidentiality, accountability, and risk management. However, I believe your recommendations would be stronger if you included more details on DPS’s employee training initiatives and how vendor contracts ensure GDPR compliance.</p>

											<p>The real world incident you included, where unauthorised access to sensitive client information occurred due to inadequate access controls, was especially valuable. You explained well how the breach was addressed, particularly your contribution in developing automated scripts, implementing User Access Control (UAC) prompts, and applying Active Directory Policies to restrict access. This example highlights both the immediate steps taken to mitigate risks and the long-term measures put in place to prevent similar incidents.</p>

											<p>Overall, your post offers a clear and insightful reflection on DPS’s approach to data protection. It provides practical suggestions and real world examples that demonstrate a strong understanding of GDPR compliance.</p>

											<p>Securing Data, Building Trust: Aligning IT Codes with GDPR Best Practices

												<p>In my initial post, I reviewed the IT Code of Conduct at a Sixth Form College in the UK, examining how its policies align with GDPR principles and protect personal data. The College's core Code of Conduct is supported by specific policies on internet use, password protocols and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) guidelines, highlighting the importance of data protection and secure access. I emphasised best practices such as the clear Data Protection Policy which outlines responsibilities and procedures for data access requests and retention, along with the Internet Acceptable Use Policy which applies to both staff and students. As the European Commission (2019) highlights, having clear policies in place for data protection is crucial for organisations to comply with GDPR principles and build trust with individuals.</p>
											<p>A key theme in the discussion was the importance of aligning IT codes of conduct with GDPR compliance. Lauren explored how Amazon implements strict guidelines for handling personal data, including multi-factor authentication and encryption. She also stressed the need for continuous staff training to maintain GDPR compliance and prevent issues like phishing attacks, supporting the idea that training and awareness are essential to ensuring staff handle data responsibly (Pechey, 2024).</p>
											<p>Milosz further developed these points by focusing on Microsoft’s approach to GDPR within its IT Code of Conduct. He highlighted their efforts to ensure secure data processing, transparency and access control, all of which align with GDPR principles. Milosz also reflected on an incident where a software update caused disruption, demonstrating the real-world impact of weak security protocols. This reinforced the need for robust security systems, particularly in cloud environments, to prevent breaches and maintain trust (Gembicki, 2024).</p>
											<p>Mobeen’s post on Digital Processing Systems (DPS) also aligned with GDPR principles through risk assessments and confidentiality measures. However, he noted areas for improvement, such as clearer data retention policies and more explicit employee training. He shared an incident where unauthorised access to sensitive data occurred, but DPS responded with stricter access controls and automated scripts. Mobeen recommended integrating Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools and strengthening vendor agreements to better secure sensitive information and ensure compliance (Ali, 2024). According to the National Cyber Security Centre (2024), regular audits and clear incident response protocols are essential to prevent such disruptions and maintain compliance with GDPR.</p>
											<p>In summary, all posts emphasise the importance of embedding GDPR principles into an organisation's IT Code of Conduct. While different organisations demonstrate strong data protection practices, common themes include the need for clearer data retention policies, improved employee training and stronger oversight of third party vendors. The incidents discussed highlight the need for continuous monitoring, clear incident response protocols and regular audits to maintain GDPR compliance and uphold organisational trust.</p>

											<p>The process of requesting and displaying a web page begins when a user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into their web browser.

											<p>The browser then queries a DNS server to translate the domain name into its corresponding IP address. Once the IP address is obtained, the browser initiates a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request to the web server at that address. This request traverses the internet infrastructure through multiple routers using TCP/IP protocols until it reaches the destination server.

											<h2>Emerging Technologies and Network</h2>
											<h3>Key Terms</h3>
											
											<p><b>Internet of Things:</b> The Internet of Things refers to the network of physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.</p>
											
											<p><b>Edge Computing:</b> Edge computing is a distributed computing framework where data processing is done closer to the data source rather than relying solely on a central server. This reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, and enhances real time decision making.</p>
											
											<p><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</b> Artificial Intelligence involves the development of algorithms and systems that can simulate human intelligence. This includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision and robotics.</p>
											<h3>Case Study</h3>
											<p>A Survey on the Convergence of Edge Computing and AI for UAVs: Opportunities and Challenges (McEnroe et al. 2022)</p>
											<p>The case study examines the combination of Edge Computing and AI in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones. This integration enables real time data processing for faster decision making and improved autonomous flight capabilities. AI allows drones to comprehend complex environments while edge computing minimises latency by processing data closer to the source. This ensures quick responses during critical operations.</p>
											<p>The technological integration enhances drone performance in surveillance, search and rescue operations and environmental monitoring. Edge computing lets drones analyse sensor data locally on the device. This reduces dependence on remote servers and improves overall response times. The approach marks a significant advancement in drone technology by merging AI's analytical capabilities with edge computing's efficiency to create more responsive unmanned aerial systems.</p>
											<h3>Issues and Challenges</h3>
											<ul>
											<li>Limited Computational resources</li>
											</ul>
											<p>UAVs are typically constrained by size and weight, which limits their computational power. Running AI models locally on drones requires significant processing capability.</p>
											<ul>

													<h3>Compare and Contrast: Linear and Non-Linear data structures</h3>
													<p><b>Linear Data Structures:</b></p>
													<p>In linear data structures elements are arranged in a sequential manner. Each element is connected to its previous and next element. Access to elements follows a strict order, such as the first element being accessed first (FIFO) or the last element being accessed first (LIFO).</p>
													<p>Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.</p>
													<p><b>Characteristics:</b></p>
													<ul>
														<li>Sequential: Elements are stored in a linear sequence.</li>
														<li>Memory Allocation: Typically contiguous in memory (arrays) or linked (linked lists).</li>
														<li>Operations: Generally support operations like traversal, insertion, and deletion at known locations.</li>
													</ul>
													<p><b>Non-Linear Data Structures:</b></p>
													<p>In non-linear data structures, elements are not arranged sequentially. Instead, elements can have multiple connections, allowing for a hierarchical or network structure. These structures allow more complex relationships between elements.</p>
													<p>Examples: Trees, Graphs.</p>
													<p><b>Characteristics:</b></p>
													<ul>
														<li>Non-sequential: Elements can have multiple connections and are not in a fixed order.</li>
														<li>Memory Allocation: May require pointers (graphs and trees) or other referencing mechanisms.</li>
														<li>Operations: Operations can be more complex, often involving searching, traversal (depth-first or breadth-first), and manipulation.</li>
													</ul>
												</div>
												<div class="section colour2 c col-6" style="width: 48%;">
													<h3>Compare and Contrast: Stacks and Queues</h3>
													<p><b>Stacks:</b></p>
													<p>A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It operates much like a stack of plates, where you can only add or remove plates from the top.</p>
													<p><b>Key Operations:</b></p>
													<ul>
														<li>Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.</li>
														<li>Pop: Removes the top element.</li>
														<li>Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.</li>
														<li>IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.</li>
													</ul>
													<p><b>Applications:</b></p>
													<ul>
														<li>Undo/Redo operations in software.</li>
														<li>Expression evaluation</li>
														<li>Function call management</li>
													</ul>
													
													<p><b>Queues</b></p>
													<p>A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed. It operates like a queue of people where the first person in line is the first to be served.</p>
													<p><b>Key Operations:</b></p>
													<ul>
														<li>Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.</li>
														<li>Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue.</li>
														<li>Peek: Returns the front element without removing it.</li>
														<li>IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.</li>
													</ul>

									<summary>Data Sort Using Cards</summary>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="section colour1 col-12">
											<h2>Data Sort Using Cards</h2>
											<p>Suppose you are sorting a set of cards. The right hand holds several cards which are sequentially sorted by numbers arranged from right to left, say for example, five cards with 10, 6, 5, 3, 2 arranged from right to left. Your left hand is picking up the top card from a pile of card deck. Now you insert the card that you have picked from the pile of deck into the right position within the right-hand cards, in a sorted order from right to left.</p>
											<p>Write the instructions in a step-by-step manner. Note down even a minor step that you have taken to insert the left-hand card into a correct position within the set of right-hand cards so that the right-hand card set remains sorted from right to left.</p>
											<h3>Answer:</h3>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Initial Setup:</strong> The right hand holds a sorted set of cards (10, 6, 5, 3, 2), and the left hand holds a pile of unsorted cards.</li>
												<li><strong>Pick a Card:</strong> The top card from the left hand pile is picked.</li>
												<li><strong>Compare:</strong> Starting from the rightmost card in the right hand set, the picked card is compared with the cards in the right hand set.</li>
												<li><strong>Shift Cards:</strong> If the picked card is larger than a card in the right hand set, the card is shifted one position to the left.</li>
												<li><strong>Insert:</strong> The picked card is placed in the correct position where it is no longer larger than the next card in the right hand set.</li>
												<li><strong>Repeat:</strong> The process is repeated for each new card from the left hand pile until the right hand set is fully sorted.</li>
											</ul>
											<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
											<p>Insertion sort works by building a sorted array one element at a time. The algorithm splits a collection of items into two parts: a sorted portion and an unsorted portion.</p>
											<p>Starting with the first element marked as sorted, the algorithm progressively takes each unsorted element and places it into its correct position within the sorted portion. To find this position, it compares the current element with each element in the sorted portion, moving sorted elements one position ahead to make space for the new element when necessary.</p>
											<p>The process continues until all elements have been sorted. This algorithm is particularly efficient for small data sets or nearly sorted arrays, with a time complexity of O(n&sup2;) in the average and worst cases, but O(n) in the best case when the array is already sorted.</p>

														<p><b>1. Knowledge and Understanding (30%)</b></p>

														<p>The submission demonstrates a good understanding of data structures and their application within the BlockWorks program. The use of dictionaries to store block details is appropriate for maintaining structured data, and the choice of algorithms (insertion sort for sorting and binary search for searching) is explained well. The recognition of insertion sort’s stability and simplicity for small datasets, along with binary search’s efficiency for sorted datasets, reflects a solid grasp of computational trade-offs.</p>

														However, the explanation lacks a comparison with alternative approaches. For instance, while insertion sort is suitable for small datasets, a faster algorithm like merge sort () would be more efficient if the dataset scales. Similarly, the choice of binary search assumes a sorted input, but the additional cost of sorting is not critically evaluated for dynamic datasets. This omission limits the depth of the critical analysis required under the Knowledge and Understanding criteria.</p>

												<p><b>2. Application of Knowledge and Understanding (30%)</b></p>

												<p>The algorithms are well-documented, with a clear explanation of their functionality and purpose. The use of insertion sort and binary search aligns with the application’s needs, and their implementation for tasks such as sorting blocks alphabetically and searching by name is logical. The inclusion of prerequisites and parameters for each function enhances clarity.</p>

														<p>However, the Application of Knowledge criteria requires a more comprehensive approach:
														<ul>
															<li>Edge Cases: The testing plan covers various scenarios (e.g., empty lists, reverse-sorted lists), but there is limited discussion of how the application handles unexpected inputs (e.g., invalid names or missing components).</li>
	
															<li>Scalability: The choice of insertion sort and its complexity is suitable for small datasets but is suboptimal for larger or growing datasets. This trade-off is not fully explored, particularly in relation to binary search’s reliance on sorted data.</li>
														</ul></p>

												<p><b>3. Structure and Presentation (30%)</b></p>

													<p>The report is well-structured, with clear headings and logical organization. Each function is described with prerequisites, parameters, and expected behavior, which enhances readability. The references to academic sources, such as “Introduction to Algorithms” by Cormen et al., lend credibility to the technical discussion.</p>

														<p>However, the Structure and Presentation criteria require visual aids like flowcharts or UML diagrams to illustrate the program’s design and logic. The absence of these visualizations limits the effectiveness of the explanation. </p>

												<p><b>4. Academic Integrity (10%)</b></p>

															<p>The submission includes appropriate references to credible sources, such as “Introduction to Algorithms” and “The Art of Computer Programming.” These citations support the theoretical foundations of the chosen algorithms and data structures.</p>

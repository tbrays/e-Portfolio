									<div class="section colour1 col-12"><p>Hello All,</p>
										<p>My name is Tim, and I am from Essex in England. I am currently a teacher of Computer Science in post-16 education. Before that, I worked in an IT support company assisting primary schools in establishing a computing curriculum.</p>
										<p>My time in education has been rewarding, but I feel that it has distanced me from industry. I have chosen to study for an MSc in Computer Science to further my academic knowledge and to help me understand current methodologies.</p>
										<p>I hope this course will enable me to pass new skills onto my students and better inform them about their future choices. I expect the challenge will be to rise to the level of writing and research expected at this level.</p>
										<p>I am looking forward to working with you all.</p>

									<summary>Post on using e-portfolio</summary>

										<div class="section colour2 col-12">
											<p>Currently I am a teacher employed in post 16 education. It is part of my responsibility to work with students, finding paths to their futures, whether this is moving on to university or finding employment opportunities. Beetham (2010) describes an e-portfolio as “a collection of digital resources that can be used for review, reflection and personal development planning” An e-portfolio can have different emphasis, for example, development, showcase or assessment. During the two years of study, the students make use of ‘Morrisby’ to keep a running journal of their experiences and achievements. This can then be used to create a showcase e-portfolio for use in applications.</p>
											<p>E-portfolios provide unbridled access and distribution, allowing them to be updated and shared from anywhere to anywhere.  This provides the tools for reflective practice as suggested by Slepcevic & Stock (2018). It also allows for a variety of materials to be used, be it text, images, video or sound.  This is beneficial to assisting learning and for bringing attention to potential employers.</p>
											<p>A complication is that establishing an e-portfolio takes time and effort and can prove technically challenging dependent on the chosen format.</p>
											<p>In summary, an e-portfolio has more benefit to student learning and career prospects, than any drawbacks. In my experience, e-portfolios have proven their use in further education and will provide the same benefits in higher education. For this reason, I will be happy to keep an e-portfolio during my studies and will enjoy developing it as a website.</p>

											<p>Hi Tim,</p>
											<p>Thank you for your post and your insight into e-portfolios. I agree with the points raised and when we have an organised and well structured e-portfolio it enables us to have clear visibility of our progress, and to be aware of what topics and areas we need to focus more on. We can then look to bridge the gaps in these topics as we move forward in our careers and education pathways.</p>

											<p>Hi Tim,</p>
											<p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts on e-Portfolios and how it will impact your career in education. I am also from a background in education, so I understand the need for staying up-to-date with the newest trends in technology to ensure students are learning a curriculum that will be relevant and useful to them in the future. I also agree that having a variety of photos and videos on the e-Portfolio makes it a lot more engaging for future employees.</p>
											<p>Thank you for your inputs and all the best in your journey!</p>

											<p>Hello Tim,</p>
											<p>It's commendable that you work as a teacher in post-16 education, guiding students towards their future paths, whether through university or employment opportunities. Your description of an e-portfolio using Beetham's (2010) definition is precise and very insightful. I completely agree that e-portfolios offer unrestricted access and flexible distribution, allowing updates and sharing from anywhere to anywhere.</p>
											<p>Furthermore, utilizing a variety of materials such as text, images, video, and sound enhances learning and attracts the attention of potential employers. Of course, creating an e-portfolio requires time and effort and can be technically challenging depending on the chosen format, but the substantial benefits it provides to students outweigh these drawbacks.</p>
											<p>From my experience, e-portfolios have proven their value in higher education, and I will be happy to use them during my studies. I am excited to develop it as a website and fully utilize its potential.</p>

											<p>Hi Tim,</p>
											<p>Thank you for this post! It is very interesting to look at this from a teacher's perspective.</p>
											<p>I think any students who are looking to go into enterprise IT should definitely start on their e-portfolios as soon as possible. It's a good way to showcase skills before entering the actual working environment, as without experience, it can be difficult to break into the field at times.</p>
											<p>I also agree that photos and videos are good ways of showcasing work. I believe that creating a YouTube channel and linking it to your e-portfolio is another excellent method to display exactly what a student has done in their e-portfolio. It is also a good way to share knowledge.</p>
											<p>Doing these things will definitely prove to an employer that the student has the determination to excel in the specified field. As an IT manager, this is something that would go a long way with me.</p>

											<h3>Feedback</h3>
											<p>Hi Tim,</p>
				
											<p>Thank you for your assignment submission which I have enjoyed reading. Overall, this was a good submission for the induction assignment, which has earned you a pass mark.  Please see below some general feedback which I hope you find useful.</p>  
											<p><b>Quality of written expression & presentation</b> Your writing has been well presented with a good introduction into your field of study. You have demonstrated a good level of English and the ideas presented in the main body of your essay have been suitably discussed with clear evidence of critical analysis. This then leads to a conclusion where you highlight your expectations and provide your final thoughts on this topic. Moving forward in your studies, in this assignment you were asked to reflect on your expectations and therefore ‘I’ (first person) was suitable.  Please note that in your upcoming modules you should usually use the third person in academic writing and not use the first person (unless it is a reflective assignment or requires your personal experience).  So by this I mean you need to avoid using "I", "we" and "me" etc.</p> 
											<p><b>Follows instructions:</b> Addresses the set question, Shows good understanding, Meets the word countOverall, you have clearly addressed the various points from the assignment question demonstrating a good level of understanding of the specific requirements of this task. You have met the word count of 750 (+10%). Your essay was 615 words and the maximum allowed word count was 825. As you begin your studies it is important to always aim to use the full number of words allowed in an assessment as this provides you the scope to demonstrate more of your critical analysis and deeper understanding of the topic.</p>
											<p><b>Academic integrity & wider reading</b> You have utilised a good range of further research to support your analysis of this topic. There is evidence of your understanding of the requirements of an academic writing style. In-text citations and a references list have been incorporated into your writing. The references list needed to be in alphabetical order.
											<p>As you start your subject modules, I would advise you to continue to utilise the UoE library resources  and/or Google Scholar to search for academically credible sources (journals, peer-reviewed texts and academic textbooks) that you can refer to as supporting evidence in your future assessments. It is always advisable to avoid unreliable, non peer-reviewed sources, such as internet blogs, Wikipedia, essay repository sites and so on as these are really not appropriate to use in academic writing at this level.</p>  
											<p>I would like to congratulate you on passing the induction module and hope that you have found it both informative and beneficial. I wish you the best of luck as you start your studies with UoE.</p>

              <h2>Tim Brayshaw BEng VR</h2>
              </br>
              <p>My name is Tim Brayshaw and I am a teacher with a diverse background in education and the military. My career began with a focus on developing computing curriculums for primary schools when most classrooms had just a couple of computers. I facilitated the creation of computer suites, allowing entire classes to participate in lessons rather than just one or two students at a time.</p>

              <p>I also served as a reservist in the British Army with the Royal Signals. My responsibilities included training new soldiers in their trades, which was immensely rewarding and inspired me to pursue a career in teaching.</p>

              <p>Currently, I work as a teacher in post-16 education and live in Essex, England. My journey has been driven by a passion for teaching and a commitment to helping students develop the skills they need for the future.

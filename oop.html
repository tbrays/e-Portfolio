											<p><b>Factors which Influence Reusability</b></p>
											<p>"Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing reusable object-oriented software is even harder" (Gamma et al, 1994). Reusability is a powerful strategy for saving time, reducing costs and improving reliability. By reusing established components, developers can avoid reinventing the wheel and focus on innovation and improving functionality.</p>

											<p>Reusability starts in the planning phase, Requirements Analysis and Architecture Driven Approach form the backbone of reusable software. Design Patterns, Modules and Algorithms provide the ability to reuse code from other projects. Testing, Documentation and service contract support a reliable and adaptable project. By focusing on foundational elements and using reusable elements, software development becomes more efficient and sustainable.</p>

											<p>Software reusability is an important concept of object-oriented development"and"Padhy et al. (2018) present eleven key reusability factors in Table 1 of their paper.</p>
											<p>Having read the paper, I would offer the following prioritisation, listed from highest to lowest importance:</p>
											<ol>
											<li><b>Requirement Analysis (RA)</b>"- Requirement analysis should have the highest priority as it forms the foundation of any software development project. Without a clear understanding of requirements, it is impossible to create reusable components that will serve their intended purpose effectively."As"Padhy et al. (2018) note,"requirements must satisfy contracts, standards, and formal specifications.</li>
											<li><b>Documentation in Project (DIP)</b>"- Proper documentation is necessary for reusability because it helps other developers to understand and use components. This includes technical documentation and requirement specification analysis created during the SDLC.</li>
											<li><b>Design Patterns (DP)</b>"- Design patterns present solutions to common problems and enhance reusability. When"existing designs can be reused"again for similar requirements, development time is reduced and reliability is improved as the patterns have been previously tested and validated.</li>
											<li><b>Modules in Programme (MIP)</b>"- Modular programming is essential for reusability as it allows components to be easily separated and recombined. Each module should be a self-contained, executable part of the application that serves a specific purpose.</li>
											<li><b>Knowledge Requirement (KR)</b>"- Understanding the knowledge requirements, including experience, ideas, and reasoning behind components, is vital for effective reuse. This factor is ranked lower than documentation because good documentation can help transfer this knowledge.</li>
											<li><b>Architecture Driven Approach (ADP)</b>"- Whilst important for"overall"structure, the architecture approach is less critical for individual component reuse than the above factors. However, it remains significant for ensuring components can work together effectively.</li>
											</ol>
											<p>The remaining factors (Service Contracts, Test Cases/Design, Used Data, Models, and Algorithms)"whilst"important, have less direct impact on reusability"in my view"than those listed above. For example, algorithms can be modified more easily than entire architectures, and test cases, whilst valuable, can"be recreated"if necessary.</p>
											<p>This prioritisation emphasises the human and organisational factors (requirements, documentation, knowledge) over purely technical aspects, as these tend to be more challenging to recreate or modify later. As Seth et al. (2011) observe, the success of object-oriented programming largely depends on its ability to model real-world problems effectively, which begins with proper requirement analysis and documentation.</p>

											<p>Thank you for sharing your insights on the prioritisation of reusability factors. Your analysis is both thorough and well supported, particularly in highlighting the importance of human centric elements like requirement analysis and documentation. I agree with your point that a clear understanding of requirements is crucial for aligning software with project goals and ensuring better planning and design decisions. The value of documentation cannot be overstated, as it plays a key role in enabling the reuse and long term maintainability of components.</p>
											<p>One suggestion I would make to strengthen your analysis is to include examples from real world projects to illustrate how these factors interact in practice. Demonstrating how poor requirement analysis or inadequate documentation affected the reuse of components in an actual project could make the argument even more compelling.</p>
											<p>Overall, your ranking and reasoning are clear and well supported, providing a solid basis for understanding the factors that contribute to software reusability.</p>

											<p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the ranking and reasoning for the reusability features. I feel that your analysis shows a clear understanding of how each factor impacts software development. Your points are both insightful and well supported, making it easy to see how you arrived at your conclusions.</p>
											<p>I agree that the architecture driven approach helps with the scalability and reusability of a project.

											<p><b>Factors which Influence Reusability</b></p>
											<p>In my initial post, I discussed the factors influencing reusability in object oriented programming (OOP). I prioritised these factors based on the idea that reusability begins early in the planning phase, with Requirements Analysis (RA) and an Architecture Driven Approach (ADP) providing the foundation for scalable and adaptable software. I also focused on the importance of design patterns, well structured modules, and reusable algorithms in improving development efficiency and reducing redundancy.</p>
											<p>Todd's reply challenged my prioritisation by emphasising Knowledge Requirements. Drawing on his experience with Python development, Todd argued that the knowledge gained from previous projects directly influences programming decisions. He highlighted how his understanding of inheritance, design patterns, and testing had improved his ability to create reusable software (Edge, 2024).</p>
											<p>Craig's reply also reinforced the value of experience. While he agreed with my prioritisation of RA he highlighted the importance of experience in influencing design decisions, noting that as developers gain more knowledge, they can make better decisions about what will lead to reusable software (Bourne, 2024).</p>
											<p>Reflecting on the feedback, I realised I may have ranked Knowledge Requirements too low. As someone with limited experience in software development, I had placed greater emphasis on the research and planning stages, such as RA and ADP, without fully recognising the importance of accumulated knowledge in shaping design decisions. I now see that experience and knowledge should be more prominent in the hierarchy, as they directly impact the reusability of software. Reuse-by-Memory and Reuse-by-Recall highlights how developers with more experience are better able to recall and identify relevant components from previous projects, making them more efficient at reusing code, as experienced developers can more easily recognise reusable solutions compared to less experienced ones who rely on retrieval tools (McCarey et al., 2005)</p>
											<p>Overall, the discussion strengthened my understanding of reusability, with differing perspectives on prioritisation. The feedback from Todd and Craig underscored the importance of balancing planning and experience.</p>

											<p><b>Group Feedback from Tutor</b></p>
											<p>Thank you for your contributions to the discussion forum. It’s fantastic to see the level of engagement and thoughtfulness in your posts, as well as the effort you’ve put into critically analysing and prioritising the factors influencing reusability in object-oriented software.</p>
											<p>A key strength across the group is your ability to explore and justify your rankings. Many of you have considered the practical implications of each factor, showing how they might apply in real-world scenarios. This approach not only demonstrates your understanding of the topic but also highlights your ability to connect theory to practice, which is a crucial skill at this level.</p>
											<p>It’s also great to see constructive peer engagement. Discussions that compare and contrast different perspectives help deepen understanding and encourage critical thinking. Building on others’ ideas, challenging assumptions, or providing alternative viewpoints are excellent ways to enhance these interactions and make the discussions even more enriching.</p>
											<p>For future posts, I encourage everyone to focus on critical analysis and synthesis rather than just describing concepts. Use examples or evidence to support your points and explain how they influence your thinking. When responding to peers, aim to expand on their ideas or provide constructive feedback to add depth to the discussion.</p>

												<h2>19.10 Glossary</h2>
	
												<p><b>Conditional Expression:</b></p>
												<p>Describes an expression that evaluates to one of two possible outcomes based on a condition.</br>
												Useful for concise decision making logic within expressions.</p>
												<p><b>List Comprehension:</b></p>
												<p>A concise way to create lists by combining a for loop and an optional conditional statement inside square brackets.</br>
												Enables more readable and compact list creation.</p>
												<p><b>Generator Expression:</b></p>
												<p>Like a list comprehension but uses parentheses instead of square brackets, producing a generator object.</br>
												More memory efficient as it generates items one by one rather than all at once.</p>
												<p><b>Multiset:</b></p>
												<p>Represents a set like structure where elements can appear multiple times, and their counts are significant.</br>
												Often implemented using collections like collections.Counter in Python.</br>
												<p><b>Factory:</b></p>
												<p>A function designed to create and return objects, often used for encapsulating object creation logic.</br>
												Facilitates consistent object creation and can simplify code by abstracting complex initialisation.</p>

									<h3>Project Astrid</h3>
										<p>As a Software Engineer, you are given the role of designing the software which supports the operation of a humanoid robot.&nbsp;In your research on the capabilities of humanoid robots, you can search for keywords that include robot, human-robot interaction, and collaborative robot.</p>
										<p>You are required to identify three operations which you wish to support in your software, from the perspective of a robot fulfilling a job, and providing capability for them through the use of an&nbsp;object-oriented Python program.&nbsp;The system should support the ability of a human to interact with the system through a front-end command-line interface (CLI).</p>
										<p>Running in the system back-end should be a capability that simulates the generation and collection of data attributes to represent the wider environment within which the robot exists.</p>

											<div class="col-6 section">
												<a href="assets/Project Astrid - Design.pdf" download="Project Astrid - Design.pdf">Project Astrid - Design</a>

												<p>Your rationale is highly innovative, focusing on a futuristic yet plausible use case for a humanoid robot in space logistics. The inclusion of background research on advancements in humanoid robotics and collaborative robots provides strong support for your design choices. The emphasis on modularity and task execution in dynamic environments is well-aligned with the logistical challenges of a moon base. However, the rationale could benefit from deeper exploration of the unique challenges faced in lunar environments, such as reduced gravity or the need for energy efficiency, and how these constraints influence your design.</p>

												<p>Your UML diagrams provide a comprehensive view of the system architecture. The class diagram clearly delineates the relationships and responsibilities of the core classes, and the state transition diagram effectively captures the robot's lifecycle during delivery operations. The activity and sequence diagrams are detailed and enhance the understanding of system workflows. However, additional annotations or explanations in the diagrams could clarify complex interactions, particularly in the sequence diagram where multiple entities interact simultaneously.</p>

												<p>The use of lists, stacks, and queues is well-justified and aligns with the system's requirements. For example, the stack’s use in backtracking the robot's path is a thoughtful implementation of its LIFO nature. Similarly, the queue-based BFS for pathfinding demonstrates a practical approach to navigation. While the data structure selection is strong, including pseudocode or examples to illustrate their integration into the system would provide a clearer connection between design and implementation.</p>

												<p>Your document is well-organised, with a clear structure and professional formatting. The diagrams are visually clean and integrate seamlessly with the text. However, the readability of some sections, particularly the technical descriptions of data structures and their implementation, could be improved by using bullet points or tables. Additionally, the reference section is comprehensive, but ensuring explicit inline citations where references support specific design decisions would strengthen academic rigour.</p>

												<p>Your references are varied and well-chosen, ranging from academic research to industry sources. This adds credibility to your submission. To further enhance this aspect, explicitly linking each reference to the specific elements of your design that they informed would better demonstrate the influence of your research.</p>

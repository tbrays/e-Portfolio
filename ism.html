											<h3>Risks of Digitalisation of Business Models </h3>
											<h3>Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019</h3>

											<p><b>What is Industry 4.0?</b></p>
											<p>Industry 4.0 is the latest Industrial Revolution. It refers to the integration of advanced digital technologies into manufacturing and industrial processes. This transformation emphasises the use of cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing to create smart factories and interconnected production systems (McKinsey, 2022). The goal is to achieve greater efficiency, flexibility and customisation in production.</p>
											<p><b>Risk Categories</b></p>
											<p>Kovaite and Stankeviciene (2019) categorise risks of digitalisation in business models into six main categories:
											<ul>
												<li>Technical Risks: System failures, software bugs, IoT issues</li>
												<li>Competence Risks: Lack of skills for Industry 4.0</li>
												<li>Acceptance by Staff Risks: Employee resistance to digitalisation</li>
												<li>Acceptance by Customers and Partners: Reluctance to adopt digital solutions</li>
												<li>Data Privacy and Security Risks: Cybersecurity threats, hacking risks</li>
												<li>Financial Risks: High costs, investment risks</li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											<p><b>Example One</b></p>
											<p>UnitedHealth Group Data Breach 2024 (Siddiqui, 2024) What happened? A cyberattack on Change Healthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group, exposed the personal data of 110 million Americans, making it the largest healthcare data breach in U.S. history. Why is this a Technical Risk? The breach was caused by not using Multifactor Authentication (MFA), a weakness in the company's IT infrastructure, demonstrating a failure to secure its systems properly.</p>
											<p><b>Example Two</b></p>
											<p>Krispy Kreme Cyberattack 2024 (Rogers, 2024) What happened? Krispy Kreme’s cyberattack caused major operational disruptions, leading to losses in revenue. Why is this a Financial Risk? The company had to invest heavily in cybersecurity measures while suffering financial setbacks due to downtime.</p>
											<p><b>Support</b></p>
											<p>The Impact of Digital Transformation on Business Models and Competitive Advantage, Agustian et al (2023). 
											Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) argue that Industry 4.0-driven digitalisation is no longer optional but essential for maintaining competitiveness. Agustian et al. (2023) reinforce this idea by stating that businesses must integrate digital technology to remain relevant, emphasising that digital transformation has become a strategic imperative rather than a choice.</p>
											<p>Both highlight key risks associated with digital transformation:
											<ul>
												<li>Technical Risks: Challenges include system integration failures, outdated IT infrastructure, and rapid technological changes, requiring heavy investment in modern systems.</li>
												<li>Competence Risks: A skilled workforce is essential, yet many businesses struggle to train employees and attract IT professionals, making upskilling a priority.</li>
												<li>Data Privacy & Security Risks: Digitalisation increases cyber threats, hacking and data breaches, making strong security measures and regulatory compliance essential.</li>
												<li>Acceptance Risks: Employee resistance to automation and customer scepticism toward digital business models can hinder adoption, requiring effective change management.</li>
											</ul>

											<h3>The Risks of Digitalisation</h3>
											<p>Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019) discuss Industry 4.0 as being the 4th industrial revolution which has seen the decentralisation of interaction between humans and machines. This decentralisation has been driven by the emergence of key technologies: the Internet of things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, robotics, and artificial intelligence  (Schwab, Davis, & Nadella, 2018; Li, 2018; Xu, Xu & Li, 2018; Roblek, Meško, & Krapež, 2016).</p>

											<p>The authors discuss six categories of risk in relation to a company’s digitalisation. These are detailed in the following table, alongside examples of risks that fit into said categories:</p>
											<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
												<thead>
													<tr>
														<th><strong>Risk category</strong></th>
														<th><strong>Example 1</strong></th>
														<th><strong>Example 2</strong></th>
													</tr>
												</thead>
												<tbody>
													<tr>
														<td>Technical risks</td>
														<td>Moving to cloud-based technologies such as Microsoft Azure.</td>
														<td>Choosing to incorporate AI Chatbots as main point of contact for customers.</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Competence risks</td>
														<td>Staff not utilising version control when collaborating on documents.</td>
														<td>Staff not being vigilant in accepting software updates on their devices.</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Acceptance by customers and partners</td>
														<td>Customers giving up part-way through using digital interfaces and choosing not to use services.</td>
														<td>Partners disagreeing with software choices because of lack of compatibility with own software systems.</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Acceptance by staff</td>
														<td>Fall-off of staff work ethic as they disagree with new systems and purposefully work at a slower pace or increase absences.</td>
														<td>Staff attempting to bypass processes, for example saving on personal USB devices rather than using cloud storage.</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Data privacy and security</td>
														<td>SQL injection attacks stealing customer data.</td>
														<td>DDOS attacks bringing online operations to a standstill.</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Financial risks</td>
														<td>Having to increase spending to improve hardware that will run new software efficiently.</td>
														<td>Having to increase payment to train staff to use new technologies.</td>
													</tr>

											<p>Yin et al. (2024) similarly found that risk increases with digitalisation, by way of higher supply-chain centrality. Additionally, Yin et al. (2024) found that business diversification increased operational risk.</p>

											<p>Thanks for your post.</p>

											<p>Your examples of the six risk categories from Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) really help show how these risks play out in real situations. I found the point from Yin et al. (2024) about increased supply-chain centrality interesting too. It made me think that while digitalisation can improve communication and efficiency, which should widen the supply base, it can actually lead to certain businesses becoming more central and therefore more vulnerable. Maybe some network level risk categories could be added to the original framework.</p>

												<p>Overall, this is a well-structured report that provides a good overview of the risks associated with both the current business model and the proposed digitalisation changes. Please find the detailed feedback below:</p>

												<p><b>1. Knowledge and Understanding of the Topic</b>
													<ul>
														<li>The report demonstrates an awareness of risk assessment concepts, highlighting both the risks of maintaining the status quo and the risks of digital transformation.</li>
														<li>Identifies various threats to Pampered Pets, including cybersecurity risks and operational risks.</li>
														<li>The methodology selection needs a stronger justification. Why was this particular approach chosen over others? A comparison with alternatives (e.g., qualitative vs. quantitative risk assessment) would strengthen the analysis.</li>
													</ul>
												</p>
												<p><b>2. Application of Knowledge and Understanding</b>
													<ul>
														<li>The report discusses relevant risks and applies them to the business scenario effectively.</li>
														<li>Some potential mitigations are suggested to address identified risks.</li>
														<li>More specific technical solutions (e.g., cybersecurity measures, cloud adoption strategies) should be included.</li>
													</ul>
												</p>
												<p><b>3. Criticality</b>
													<ul>
														<li>The report attempts to evaluate risks from multiple perspectives.</li>
														<li>Some risks of digital transformation (e.g., supply chain vulnerabilities, security threats) are acknowledged.</li>
														<li>The analysis could be more balanced by providing counterarguments. For instance, while digitalization has risks, are they outweighed by benefits?</li>
														<li>The evaluation of international supply chains is too general; more focus on specific risks such as compliance, logistics, or supplier reliability is needed.</li>
													</ul>
												</p>
												<p><b>4. Structure and Presentation</b>
													<ul>
														<li>The document is structured with clear sections.</li>
														<li>Use of bullet points helps in clarity and conciseness.</li>
														<li>Some sections appear rushed or underdeveloped—certain arguments need elaboration.</li>
														<li>The use of citations and references needs improvement. Proper academic referencing (e.g., Harvard) should be maintained.</li>

												<p>This good assignment shows initiative, a strong grasp of relevant tools, and excellent implementation skills. Please find the detailed feedback below:</p>

												<p><b>1. Knowledge and Understanding of the Topic/Issues Under Consideration</b></p>

												<ul>
													<li>The work shows strong domain knowledge in risk modelling and cybersecurity, especially with the use of attack trees, STRIDE, and DREAD methodologies.</li>
													<li>Demonstrates clear understanding of how digital transformation shifts risk profiles (e.g., from physical/process risks to cyber/human-centric threats).</li>
													<li>While the project demonstrates applied understanding, a deeper theoretical foundation or critical engagement with academic frameworks around digital security management could enhance the discussion.</li>
													<li>The executive summary could briefly reference wider industry standards or comparative approaches.</li>
												</ul>

												<p><b>2. Criticality</b></p>

												<ul>
													<li>Good level of critical reflection in evaluating technology choices.</li>
													<li>The tool’s limitations are implicitly acknowledged in the “Future Development” section.</li>
													<li>The critique of the tools and frameworks used is practical, but there’s limited critical engagement with the broader implications of digital risk modelling (e.g., the ethical, organisational, or user-experience aspects).</li>
													<li>No comparative critique of attack trees versus other risk representation methods</li>
												</ul>

												<p><b>3. Use of Relevant Sources</b></p>
												<ul>
													<li>The report uses appropriate technical and tool-based documentation.</li>
													<li>Includes references and bibliography with a good mix of academic, documentation, and multimedia sources.</li>
													<li>Source material leans heavily on documentation and lacks peer-reviewed academic sources. Including journal articles or scholarly texts related to digital risk modelling or ISM would strengthen credibility.</li>
													<li>Citations for statements about risk impact and decision-making tools would benefit from grounding in scholarly work.</li>
												</ul>

												<p><b>4. Structure and Presentation</b></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Professionally formatted with clear sections (Executive Summary, Application Presentation, Testing, Code Structure, etc.).</li>
													<li>Logical flow from context to tool design, implementation, testing, and evaluation.</li>
													<li>Effective use of visual elements (sunburst diagrams, screenshots) to support understanding.</li>
													<li>Some sections (e.g., manual testing) are underexplained; instead of listing “Test One,” “Test Two,” etc., they could include descriptions, expected outcomes, and results.</li>
												</ul>

												<p><b>5. Academic Integrity</b></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Codebase is original and openly shared via GitHub, showing transparency.</li>
													<li>References are correctly cited using appropriate formats.</li>
													<li>Could explicitly state how collaboration, tool usage, or AI-assisted coding was handled, if applicable, to further enhance transparency.</li>

												<h3>Feedback</h3>

												<p>This strong reflection demonstrates real growth in independent learning, practical application, and critical awareness of the module's content and delivery. The student’s adaptive use of unfamiliar tools, clear articulation of learning processes, and engagement with theory provide an excellent foundation for future learning. Please find the complete feedback below:</p>

												<p><b>1. Knowledge and Understanding of the Topic</b></p>
												<ul>
													<li>The student provides a solid understanding of core concepts in Information Security Management—risk assessment, threat modelling, security governance—and references relevant frameworks. The reflection also shows awareness of practical applications using libraries like Plotly and NiceGUI.</li>
													<li>At times, the understanding of some frameworks (e.g., risk assessments) seems surface-level. The student acknowledges this, which is reflective, but a more in-depth explanation or critique would enhance clarity.</li>
												</ul>

												<p><b>2. Criticality</b></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Good evaluation of content gaps, critical analysis of their impact, and strong engagement with pedagogical theory (e.g., Biggs & Tang, Petty).</li>
													<li>The reflection could go further in critically examining the student’s own work—e.g., what could have been improved beyond the structural and content challenges of the module?</li>
												</ul>

												<p><b>3. Application of Knowledge and Understanding</b></p>
												<ul>
													<li>The student clearly applied what they learned: selecting appropriate tools (e.g., NiceGUI and Plotly), integrating JSON for structured comparisons, and writing automated tests with pytest. The reflection provides good examples of how theory-informed practice.</li>
													<li>Could include more about how risk modelling frameworks (STRIDE, DREAD) influenced the functionality of the final application.</li>
												</ul>

												<p><b>4. Collaboration / Independent Working</b></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Their shift to more self-directed learning is well-reflected and well-theorised. Excellent demonstration of resilience, autonomy, and self-motivation. Effective reflection on how collaboration was limited but substituted with independent strategies.</li>
												</ul>

												<p><b>5. Academic Integrity</b></p>
												<ul>
													<li>All sources are properly cited, including technical literature (Shostack) and pedagogical theory. The GitHub and Replit repositories are clearly referenced.</li>
												</ul>
												
												<p><b>6. Structure and Presentation</b></p>
												<ul>
													<li>The assignment is well-organised and follows the Rolfe et al. model. Sections are logically laid out, and transitions between ideas are smooth. The use of page breaks and subheadings (if in original format) supports readability.</li>
													<li>Visual support (e.g., screenshots, diagrams) could strengthen presentation, particularly when describing the GUI or sunburst charts.</li>

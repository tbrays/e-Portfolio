									<summary>Discussion Post: Review of IT Code of Conduct</summary>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="section colour1 col-12">
											<p><b>Review of IT Code of Conduct</b></p>
											<p><b>Key Documents</b></p>
											<p>The document "Communication: Data protection rules as a trust-enabler in the EU and beyond – taking stock" (European Commission, 2019) talks about the critical role of data protection in forming trust among individuals, businesses and public authorities. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 2016) outlines data protection laws for the European Union. It establishes the right of individuals regarding personal data. It should be noted that UK organisations no longer need to comply with these documents but with the UK versions of them.</p>
											
											<p> I reviewed the established Code of Conduct for a Sixth Form College in the UK. There is a core Code of Conduct document that is supported by individual documents covering, such as the Internet Acceptable Use Policy, the Setting Passwords Protocol, and the BYOD to Work Policy.</p>
											
											<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
											<p>The Data Protection Policy follows the GDPR(UK) and lays out the responsibilities for protecting personal data. A lot of student and teacher data is held, and this document is clear but comprehensive, including procedures for data access requests and a data retention schedule. The Internet Acceptable Use Policy defines what is reasonable behaviour and what actions could compromise the network. This is an important document as it not only applies to teachers but also to students.</p>
											
											<p><b>Areas for Improvement</b></p>
											<p>When conducting this research, I found that each of the policies and procedures were b but found it difficult 
to locate them. They are all stored in one folder with all the other college policy documents. A unified Code of Conduct 
document could improve comprehension of the subjects and therefore compliance. However, retaining separate documents can 
allow for more detail to be included for each.</p>
											
											<p><b>Incident Reflection</b></p>
											<p>Recently the sixth form conducted a simulated phishing attack to see the actions of staff. Many staff opened the email and read it, and many opened the attachment that asked for a username and password. The exercise highlighted the need for ongoing staff education and clear reporting protocols.</p>
											
											<p><b>Future Implications</b></p>
											<p>The sixth form is currently going through the process of gaining Cyber Essentials Certification (National Cyber Security Centre, N.D.) and are currently in the data collection phase. We could also establish cyber security training for new and current staff to highlight the documents and where to find them, giving key details. There was also no formal incident response plan except to tell IT support.</p>

											<p>Hi Tim,</p>

											<p>Your review of the IT Code of Conduct for the Sixth Form College highlights some critical aspects of data protection and cybersecurity. It's great to see the college's commitment to following established policies like the Data Protection Policy and Internet Acceptable Use Policy. However, I agree that the difficulty in locating these documents suggests a need for improvement. A unified Code of Conduct could enhance understanding and compliance among staff and students.</p>

											<p>The simulated phishing attack you mentioned underscores the importance of ongoing education and clear reporting protocols. It’s a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities we face, particularly in an educational setting. As the college pursues Cyber Essentials Certification, I believe formal incident response plans and comprehensive cybersecurity training will be vital. This will not only reinforce existing policies but also ensure everyone knows how to access them, fostering a stronger culture of cybersecurity awareness.</p>

											<p>Thanks for sharing these insights!</p>

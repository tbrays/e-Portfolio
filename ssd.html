											<p><b>UML and Secure Software Development</b></p>
											<p>The Open Web Application Security Project, or OSWAP, is a non-profit organisation founded in 2001 (OWASP, N.D.)  Its main goal is to help highlight vulnerabilities with website, in an effort to prevent breaches in security.</p>
											<p>In the OSWAP Top 10 list published in 2021, Broken Access Control is the number one vulnerability (OWASP, N.D.)  This is often down to developer miss configuration of the access controls.  A specific instance of this is Insure Direct Object Reference, or IDOR.  It allows users, with little or no expertise, to access information for which they do not have privileges for.  If an e-commerce site uses order IDs directly in URLs without implementing proper authorization checks, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to view or modify other users’ orders. By simply manipulating the order ID in the URL, the attacker might gain access to confidential information or alter the order details of other customers, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.</p>
											<p>“It is a common practice for practitioners to draw the system architecture as a structural component or class diagram in order to represent the relationships between the subsystems.” (Pillai, A. B., 2017)</p>
											<p>Unified Modelling Language, or UML, is modelling language that allows the visualisation of a system.  It can show software or hardware systems and is used throughout the SDLC.  It was adopted by the Object Management Group, or OMG, in 2007 and is now maintained and developed by the OMG. UML has two main sections, Structural diagrams and Behavioural diagrams.  (UoEO, N.D.)</p>

														</ul>
													</p>
												</div>
											</div>
										
											<p>In developing an application, several UML diagrams are particularly valuable. The Use Case Diagram is essential for capturing high level functional requirements and interactions between users and the system. The Class Diagram provides a clear definition of the static structure, detailing the classes, attributes, methods, and their relationships within the data model. The Sequence Diagram is crucial for illustrating the detailed interactions and the sequence of messages exchanged operations, ensuring that the process flow is well-understood. The Activity Diagram helps visualize the workflows and processes involved in various operations, offering insights into the sequence of activities and decision points necessary for efficient execution.</p>

										<p>Hi Tim,</p>
										<p>Thank you for sharing your knowledge on OWASP vulnerabilities! I agree with your emphasis on Broken Access Control, highlighted as the top vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10 list. If a company does not configure access controls, like Insure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), it can lead to significant security breaches. Your example of an e-Commerce site using order IDs directly in URLs without proper authorisation checks definitely illustrates this risk. Your discussion on Unified Modelling Language (UML) is also spot-on. UML diagrams are invaluable in identifying potential security risks.</p>
										<p>To prevent these vulnerabilities, secure coding practices and regular training for developers are essential. Implementing robust authorisation models, leveraging security frameworks, conducting regular code reviews, and security audits are also crucial for early vulnerability detection. By integrating these measures into the Secure Development Life Cycle, organisations can certainly enhance security and protect user data from unauthorised access.</p>
										<p>Thank you for your submission!</p>

											<p>In this discussion, I have chosen to explore Broken Access Control (BAC), which has become the number one vulnerability exploited by cybercriminals today (OWASP, 2021). BAC occurs when restrictions on authenticated users are not implemented correctly, allowing attackers to access unauthorised data and cause serious security breaches (MITRE, 2021). This can allow cybercriminals to take control of user’s accounts, access sensitive information and compromise an entire website by changing admin logins.</p> 
	
											<p>The following UML Sequence Diagram illustrates a serious example where BAC allows an attacker to access the admin panel and take control of the website:</p>
	
											<p>In this scenario, the admin panel URL is protected by a simple URL path check, not proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Therefore, a regular user, User B, discovers the URL of the admin panel through either simple guesswork or more advanced software engineering skills. For example, it could be as simple as adding “/admin” to the end of the URL: https://example.com/admin.</p>
	
											<p>The application does not have robust access controls in place to verify that only users with admin privileges can access this admin URL. As a result, User B gains unauthorised access to the admin functionality, allowing them to view all user accounts, change passwords and permissions of other users, delete user accounts or even change administrator passwords. This clearly leads to a severe breach of system security and data privacy (Pillai, 2017). Therefore, as a solution, it is advisable for the website to implement strong authentication mechanisms, ensuring only users with valid admin credentials can access the admin panel (Gupta et al., 2022). </p>
	
											<p>In the above diagram, the application employs authorisation checks that verify whether the authenticated user has the required administrative role before allowing access to admin functionality. Any attempts by non-admin users to access the admin panel are logged, and appropriate security measures are taken (e.g., alerts to system administrators), as suggested by Kellezi et al., (2021). In the resolved scenario, the application ensures that only properly authenticated and authorised users can access critical administrative features, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorised access and potential system compromise.</p>

										<p>Hi, I also covered Broken Access Control. This is a large category of vulnerabilities, and you have provided a concise and accurate definition. The scenario where a user discovers an admin panel through simple URL path manipulation is a very realistic example. It demonstrates how easily BAC can be exploited, by attackers, when proper access controls are not implemented.</p>
										<p>You have discussed consequences of Broken Access Control and have mentioned unauthorised access and system compromise. Expanding this by mentioning wider issues such as potential financial losses, reputational damage, or legal implications, would strengthen your argument for the need to address this particular security issue.</p>
										<p>It is great to see that you included a potential mitigation strategy for this attack. Ensuring that appropriate security settings are in place is crucial and can be reinforced through training as part of an organisation's policy.</p>
										<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts on Broken Access Control.</p>

											<p>The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation publishes the “Top 10 Web Application Security Risks” to draw attention to the most important risks that are a fundamental part of application development (OWASP Foundation, 2024). According to the top 10 for 2021, OWASP Foundation (2024) identifies in the fourth position the vulnerability of “Insecure Design”.</p>
											<p>Insecure design emphasises on risks around mistakes made during the software design and the software architecture that can be expressed as “missing or ineffective control design” (OWASP Foundation, 2021). More broadly speaking, insecure design pertains to the practice of developing software solutions where the design of the system does not adhere to secure design patterns and best-practice architectural methodologies. This results to the creation of weaknesses which a bad actor could abuse.</p>
											<p>One of the example scenarios for insecure design offered by the OWASP Foundation (2021) is one where the design of the cinema booking system has a vulnerability in its activity flow which could potentially allow a bad actor to abuse it and lead to major loss of earnings. Below, I created two flow charts that depict the decision sequence based on this scenario, one with an insecure design flaw and another with a safeguard against that flaw.</p>
											<p>The first figure features the steps leading to a particular weakness relating to insecure design. Namely, bad actors could potentially flood the booking system with free booking reservations each one made for tickets less than a certain threshold (15) and not turn up in the venue to purchase the reserved tickets. The problematic control flow is highlighted in red colour.</p>
											<p>In the second figure, the design of the system includes a safeguard against abusing the booking system by enforcing that a deposit is requested regardless of the number of tickets in the reservations. This change in the activity flow (highlighted in green colour) means that it would no longer be free for any bad actors to make artificial reservations.</p>
											<p>According to Revniuk et. al. (2024), the insecure design vulnerability arises from inadequate threat modelling performed during the software design phase. The OWASP Foundation (2021) advocates for more threat modelling as one of the key steps developers should follow in guarding against the risk of insecure design. By utilising UML diagrams, the developers of the software solution can visualise all potential activity flows and identify risks or vulnerabilities found in their proposed design. Flowcharts and activity diagrams can be used as means of producing threat modelling analysis for modelling the system, identifying weak points and developing countermeasures.</p>

										<p>Hi, you gave a detailed describe of what insecure design entails and why it is a significant concern. The cinema booking system scenario provides a practical example. It demonstrates how insecure design can lead to real world problems and illustrates the potential financial impact of such vulnerabilities.</p>
										<p>You could mention different types of threat modelling such as Stride or Vast, this would give the reader starting points to their own research and allow them to find what would be best practice for their own designs.</p>

									<p>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.</p>
									<p>“Human risk is today’s biggest Cybersecurity gap and remains largely unaddressed.” (Mimecast, 2024). Human error is the largest growing cyber security threat today, most of these could be mitigated through education. From ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 the following are five key concepts to managing the risk.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>1.	Access Control (3.1):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">Access control makes sure that only authorised personnel should have access to specific systems and information. Having and enforcing strict access control can help to mitigate this security risk. A regular review and updates of the policy helps to enhance security further.</li>
											<li>2. Information Security Policy (3.5):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">Information Security Policy should clearly outline acceptable use, security practices, and the consequences of violations. Training sessions should be conducted to ensure understand and adhere to these policies.</li> 
											<li>3. Security Awareness, Education, and Training (3.13):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">These programs should include training on recognising phishing attempts, proper data handling procedures, and the importance of reporting suspicious activities. Educated employees are more likely to follow best practices.</li>
											<li>4. Incident Management (3.8):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">An Incident Management process ensures that insider threats are found and addressed. Users should know how to report potential security incidents, and there should be a clear protocol for investigating and responding to these reports.</li>
											<li>5. Monitoring (3.10):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">Monitoring of systems and user activities allows detection of suspicious behaviour. These tools can log and analyse user actions, flagging anomalies that may show insider threats. Regular audits of these logs can help in finding patterns that suggest malicious intent or negligent behaviour.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>As cyber threats evolve, and attacks become more sophisticated, human error stays the largest threat. This points to a need for continued and enhance education to manage insider risk.</p>

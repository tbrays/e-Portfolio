												<p><b>UML and Secure Software Development</b></p>
												<p>The Open Web Application Security Project, or OSWAP, is a non-profit organisation founded in 2001 (OWASP, N.D.)  Its main goal is to help highlight vulnerabilities with website, in an effort to prevent breaches in security.</p>
												<p>In the OSWAP Top 10 list published in 2021, Broken Access Control is the number one vulnerability (OWASP, N.D.)  This is often down to developer miss configuration of the access controls.  A specific instance of this is Insure Direct Object Reference, or IDOR.  It allows users, with little or no expertise, to access information for which they do not have privileges for.  If an e-commerce site uses order IDs directly in URLs without implementing proper authorization checks, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to view or modify other users’ orders. By simply manipulating the order ID in the URL, the attacker might gain access to confidential information or alter the order details of other customers, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.</p>
												<p>“It is a common practice for practitioners to draw the system architecture as a structural component or class diagram in order to represent the relationships between the subsystems.” (Pillai, A. B., 2017)</p>
												<p>Unified Modelling Language, or UML, is modelling language that allows the visualisation of a system.  It can show software or hardware systems and is used throughout the SDLC.  It was adopted by the Object Management Group, or OMG, in 2007 and is now maintained and developed by the OMG. UML has two main sections, Structural diagrams and Behavioural diagrams.  (UoEO, N.D.)</p>

												<div class="row">

															</ul>
														</p>
													</div>
												</div>

												<p>In developing an application, several UML diagrams are particularly valuable. The Use Case Diagram is essential for capturing high level functional requirements and interactions between users and the system. The Class Diagram provides a clear definition of the static structure, detailing the classes, attributes, methods, and their relationships within the data model. The Sequence Diagram is crucial for illustrating the detailed interactions and the sequence of messages exchanged operations, ensuring that the process flow is well-understood. The Activity Diagram helps visualize the workflows and processes involved in various operations, offering insights into the sequence of activities and decision points necessary for efficient execution.</p>

											<p>Hi Tim,</p>
											<p>Thank you for sharing your knowledge on OWASP vulnerabilities! I agree with your emphasis on Broken Access Control, highlighted as the top vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10 list. If a company does not configure access controls, like Insure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), it can lead to significant security breaches. Your example of an e-Commerce site using order IDs directly in URLs without proper authorisation checks definitely illustrates this risk. Your discussion on Unified Modelling Language (UML) is also spot-on. UML diagrams are invaluable in identifying potential security risks.</p>
											<p>To prevent these vulnerabilities, secure coding practices and regular training for developers are essential. Implementing robust authorisation models, leveraging security frameworks, conducting regular code reviews, and security audits are also crucial for early vulnerability detection. By integrating these measures into the Secure Development Life Cycle, organisations can certainly enhance security and protect user data from unauthorised access.</p>

												<p>In this discussion, I have chosen to explore Broken Access Control (BAC), which has become the number one vulnerability exploited by cybercriminals today (OWASP, 2021). BAC occurs when restrictions on authenticated users are not implemented correctly, allowing attackers to access unauthorised data and cause serious security breaches (MITRE, 2021). This can allow cybercriminals to take control of user’s accounts, access sensitive information and compromise an entire website by changing admin logins.</p> 
											
												<p>The following UML Sequence Diagram illustrates a serious example where BAC allows an attacker to access the admin panel and take control of the website:</p>
											
												<p>In this scenario, the admin panel URL is protected by a simple URL path check, not proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Therefore, a regular user, User B, discovers the URL of the admin panel through either simple guesswork or more advanced software engineering skills. For example, it could be as simple as adding “/admin” to the end of the URL: https://example.com/admin.</p>
											
												<p>The application does not have robust access controls in place to verify that only users with admin privileges can access this admin URL. As a result, User B gains unauthorised access to the admin functionality, allowing them to view all user accounts, change passwords and permissions of other users, delete user accounts or even change administrator passwords. This clearly leads to a severe breach of system security and data privacy (Pillai, 2017). Therefore, as a solution, it is advisable for the website to implement strong authentication mechanisms, ensuring only users with valid admin credentials can access the admin panel (Gupta et al., 2022). </p>
											
												<p>In the above diagram, the application employs authorisation checks that verify whether the authenticated user has the required administrative role before allowing access to admin functionality. Any attempts by non-admin users to access the admin panel are logged, and appropriate security measures are taken (e.g., alerts to system administrators), as suggested by Kellezi et al., (2021). In the resolved scenario, the application ensures that only properly authenticated and authorised users can access critical administrative features, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorised access and potential system compromise.</p>

											<p>Hi, I also covered Broken Access Control. This is a large category of vulnerabilities, and you have provided a concise and accurate definition. The scenario where a user discovers an admin panel through simple URL path manipulation is a very realistic example. It demonstrates how easily BAC can be exploited, by attackers, when proper access controls are not implemented.</p>
											<p>You have discussed consequences of Broken Access Control and have mentioned unauthorised access and system compromise. Expanding this by mentioning wider issues such as potential financial losses, reputational damage, or legal implications, would strengthen your argument for the need to address this particular security issue.</p>
											<p>It is great to see that you included a potential mitigation strategy for this attack. Ensuring that appropriate security settings are in place is crucial and can be reinforced through training as part of an organisation's policy.</p>
											<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts on Broken Access Control.</p>

												<p>The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation publishes the “Top 10 Web Application Security Risks” to draw attention to the most important risks that are a fundamental part of application development (OWASP Foundation, 2024). According to the top 10 for 2021, OWASP Foundation (2024) identifies in the fourth position the vulnerability of “Insecure Design”.</p>
												<p>Insecure design emphasises on risks around mistakes made during the software design and the software architecture that can be expressed as “missing or ineffective control design” (OWASP Foundation, 2021). More broadly speaking, insecure design pertains to the practice of developing software solutions where the design of the system does not adhere to secure design patterns and best-practice architectural methodologies. This results to the creation of weaknesses which a bad actor could abuse.</p>
												<p>One of the example scenarios for insecure design offered by the OWASP Foundation (2021) is one where the design of the cinema booking system has a vulnerability in its activity flow which could potentially allow a bad actor to abuse it and lead to major loss of earnings. Below, I created two flow charts that depict the decision sequence based on this scenario, one with an insecure design flaw and another with a safeguard against that flaw.</p>
												<p>The first figure features the steps leading to a particular weakness relating to insecure design. Namely, bad actors could potentially flood the booking system with free booking reservations each one made for tickets less than a certain threshold (15) and not turn up in the venue to purchase the reserved tickets. The problematic control flow is highlighted in red colour.</p>
												<p>In the second figure, the design of the system includes a safeguard against abusing the booking system by enforcing that a deposit is requested regardless of the number of tickets in the reservations. This change in the activity flow (highlighted in green colour) means that it would no longer be free for any bad actors to make artificial reservations.</p>
												<p>According to Revniuk et. al. (2024), the insecure design vulnerability arises from inadequate threat modelling performed during the software design phase. The OWASP Foundation (2021) advocates for more threat modelling as one of the key steps developers should follow in guarding against the risk of insecure design. By utilising UML diagrams, the developers of the software solution can visualise all potential activity flows and identify risks or vulnerabilities found in their proposed design. Flowcharts and activity diagrams can be used as means of producing threat modelling analysis for modelling the system, identifying weak points and developing countermeasures.</p>

											<p>Hi, you gave a detailed describe of what insecure design entails and why it is a significant concern. The cinema booking system scenario provides a practical example. It demonstrates how insecure design can lead to real world problems and illustrates the potential financial impact of such vulnerabilities.</p>

										<p>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.</p>
										<p>“Human risk is today’s biggest Cybersecurity gap and remains largely unaddressed.” (Mimecast, 2024). Human error is the largest growing cyber security threat today, most of these could be mitigated through education. From ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 the following are five key concepts to managing the risk.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>1.	Access Control (3.1):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">Access control makes sure that only authorised personnel should have access to specific systems and information. Having and enforcing strict access control can help to mitigate this security risk. A regular review and updates of the policy helps to enhance security further.</li>
											<li>2. Information Security Policy (3.5):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">Information Security Policy should clearly outline acceptable use, security practices, and the consequences of violations. Training sessions should be conducted to ensure understand and adhere to these policies.</li> 
											<li>3. Security Awareness, Education, and Training (3.13):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">These programs should include training on recognising phishing attempts, proper data handling procedures, and the importance of reporting suspicious activities. Educated employees are more likely to follow best practices.</li>
											<li>4. Incident Management (3.8):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">An Incident Management process ensures that insider threats are found and addressed. Users should know how to report potential security incidents, and there should be a clear protocol for investigating and responding to these reports.</li>
											<li>5. Monitoring (3.10):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">Monitoring of systems and user activities allows detection of suspicious behaviour. These tools can log and analyse user actions, flagging anomalies that may show insider threats. Regular audits of these logs can help in finding patterns that suggest malicious intent or negligent behaviour.</li>
										</ul>

										<p>As cyber threats evolve, and attacks become more sophisticated, human error stays the largest threat. This points to a need for continued and enhance education to manage insider risk.</p>

											<p>The initial post focused on Broken Access Control (BAC) in particular Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) as highlighted in the OWASP Top 10 list (OWASP, 2021). It also discussed the importance of Unified Modelling Language (UML) in secure software development. UML diagrams such as Sequence and Use Case diagrams play a key role in identifying security vulnerabilities early in the development process, making them crucial tools for identifying and addressing security issues to help build more secure systems.</p>
											<p>Peer reviews agreed on the focus on BAC and the need for secure coding practices and strong authentication. One peer added value by using a UML Sequence Diagram to show how weak access controls could allow unauthorized users to access admin-level features (Petchey, 2024). This example highlighted the risks of BAC and the need for regular security audits and developer training.</p>
											<p>Concepts from the course units, such as continuous security monitoring and the use of secure coding frameworks, reinforced the ideas in the initial post. The units also stressed how UML helps visualize system structures and identify vulnerabilities, supporting the original argument that UML diagrams are crucial in secure software development. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and ISO/IEC 27000 standards highlighted the need for a structured security approach (ISO, 2022). Section 3 stressed the value of an information security management system (ISMS) and discusses the human risk factors, reinforced the importance of developer training to address vulnerabilities, aligning with peer feedback on security audits and training.</p>
											<p>Overall, the discussion strengthened the understanding of UML’s role in secure software development, especially in dealing with vulnerabilities like BAC. Insights from peers emphasized the need for secure coding, strong authentication, and authorization, helping to shape a more security focused approach for future projects. This ensures vulnerabilities are addressed throughout the Software Development Life Cycle.</p>

											<p><b>What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</b></p>
											<ul>
												<li><b>Memory Safety:</b> Languages that prevent buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and memory leaks are considered more secure. This feature is crucial in preventing vulnerabilities like buffer overflow attacks, which are common in languages like C and C++.</li>
												<li><b>Type Safety:</b> Strongly typed languages can prevent unintended data manipulation by enforcing strict rules on how data types are used. Type mismatches can lead to vulnerabilities, and strongly typed languages ensure that variables are used correctly.</li>
												<li><b>Error Handling:</b> Secure languages provide robust mechanisms to handle errors and exceptions gracefully. Proper error handling can prevent applications from crashing or entering a vulnerable state due to unexpected inputs or conditions.</li>
												<li><b>Sandboxing and Permission Control:</b> Languages like Java that provide built-in sandboxing ensure that code executes in a restricted environment, preventing unauthorized access to system resources.</li>
												<li><b>Compiler/Interpreter Security:</b> A secure language should have a well-tested compiler or interpreter that doesn’t introduce vulnerabilities during code execution.</li>
												<li><b>Standard Library Security:</b> A programming language's standard library should be secure, with well-vetted functions that avoid unsafe practices like the use of insecure cryptography algorithms or unchecked input.</li>
												<li><b>Concurrency Handling:</b> As many modern applications rely on parallel processing, languages that handle concurrency securely can prevent race conditions and data corruption.</li>
												<li><b>Community and Support:</b> A large, active community and regular updates help ensure that vulnerabilities are quickly discovered and patched.</li>
											</ul>
										
											<p><b>Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</b></p>
											<p>Python can be considered relatively secure but with some limitations. It manages memory automatically through its garbage collection mechanism, eliminating the need for direct pointer manipulation, thus reducing the risk of buffer overflows and memory-related vulnerabilities compared to languages like C.</p> 
											<p>Python is dynamically typed, meaning it doesn’t enforce type checking at compile-time, which can lead to issues when types are mixed unintentionally, though its runtime checks provide a layer of safety by throwing exceptions when types are misused.Python’s robust error-handling system, using try-except blocks, allows for efficient management of errors without crashing programs.</p> 
											<p>Python's interpreter is regularly updated to patch known vulnerabilities, but being an interpreted language, it is susceptible to injection attacks, although proper coding practices can mitigate these risks. The standard library is extensive and generally secure, though certain modules can introduce security risks if mishandled. Secure cryptographic libraries such as hashlib and ssl provide secure communication.Python benefits from a large community and frequent updates, ensuring that known vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.</p>
												
											
											<p><b>Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</b></p>
											<p>While Python is a highly flexible, general-purpose language, it is not better than C for creating operating systems for several reasons. Operating systems require low-level hardware interaction such as memory management, device drivers, and system calls, which C handles efficiently by providing direct access to memory and system resources. Python abstracts these details, which simplifies development but limits its ability to perform efficiently at the low level required for operating systems. </p>
											<p>As an interpreted language, Python is slower than compiled languages like C, and since operating systems need to be highly optimized for performance, C remains superior in terms of speed and resource management. Python’s higher-level abstractions could accelerate development for components that do not require tight resource control. </p>
											<p>In conclusion, while Python offers ease of development, C is far more suitable for operating system development due to its performance, low-level access, and mature ecosystem.</p>
										</div>
	
										<div class="section colour2 col-12">
											<p><b>Team Contributions</b></p>
											<p>One team member agreed with the conclusion but emphasized the importance of memory safety when discussing security, especially when comparing Python and C. They also suggested that Rust might be a better option for secure OS development due to its balance of performance and memory safety features.</p>

<p>Another team member pointed out Python's limitations in low-level system interaction, especially when compared to languages like C, which offers direct memory and hardware access. They argued that Python’s high-level abstractions, while improving ease of development, prevent it from being suitable for critical tasks like device driver development or kernel programming, where precise control over hardware is required. This lack of low-level access makes Python less efficient for performance-critical operations that are essential in operating system development.</p>

													<p>Stack smashing occurs when a buffer overflow overwrites data on the stack, particularly the return address or other critical variables. This can cause the program to crash or lead to security vulnerabilities where malicious code can be injected and executed.</p>

													<p>What does the output message mean?</p>
													<p>The gets() function is dangerous because it does not perform bounds checking on the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code. This problem can be avoided by using fgets() over gets(). This would allow the maximum number of characters to read from the input string to be set. This means that it would never try to enter more than the buffer can take. </p>

											Part Two – Buffer Overflow in Python
											What is the result?
											When the code is run an index error occurs. This is due to the logic error in the loop.  It loops from 0 to 10, The range function is inclusive of the lower bound and exclusive of the upper bound, giving 11 indexes.

															<p>In a producer-consumer model, the producer adds items to the queue, and the consumer processes them by retrieving items from the queue. After processing each item, the consumer calls q.task_done() to indicate that the task related to the item has been completed.

											<p>ReDOS or Regular Expression Denial of Service is an attack that exploits the inefficiencies of regular expressions.  During a ReDOS attack a specifically crafted input is used to exploit the vulnerable regular expressions. These poorly optimised expressions are known as ‘Evil Regex’.</p>
											<p>For example, the regex pattern (a+)+ is used to match sequences of one or more 'a' characters, grouped in one or more repetitions. While it may seem useful for matching strings like "a", "aa", "aaa", or "aaaa", it is problematic because it allows excessive backtracking.</p>
											<p>When the input string is complex, such as "aaaaaa", the regex engine may attempt various combinations of matching the inner and outer groups, leading to performance degradation and making it vulnerable to ReDOS attacks.</p>

												<p><b>What is recursion</b></p>
												<p>A recursive function is one that calls itself, calls itself , calls itself , calls itself , calls itself , calls itself, calls itself, calls itself, calls itself, calls itself…
												Until it meets a condition to stop.</p> 
												<p><b>When to use recursion</b></p> 
												<p>Situations where it is necessary to backtrack to previous states and continue attempting to solve the problem forward from that point (for instance, pattern matching, puzzle solving, tree traversal)</p>
													<p><b>When not to use recursion</b></p> 
												<p>When you could use a loop instead</p>

												<p>The theoretical maximum is tied to the recursion limit set by python, this can be retrieved by importing sys and using sys.getrecursionlimit().  It default is usually 1000, but can be increased with sys.setrecursionlimit().  The program ran easy for 15 disks but took time some time for 20, but still succeeded.</p>

												<p>Recursion Limit: Python sets a recursion limit of 1000 to prevent stack overflow. If the limit is set to high the program can cause a stack overflow leading to a crash.</p>
												<p>Stack Overflow Vulnerability:  If recursion is not handled properly then the system can be vulnerable to a denial of service where a stack overflow is purposely caused to crash the programme.</p>

											<p>Python equivalence partitioning</p>

											<ul>
												<li>What is Equivalence partitioning?</li>
											
												This is a method use to categorise elements into groups, based on an equivalence relation, such as having the same remainder when divided by a number.
											
												<li>Why use it?</li>
											
												It is use primarily in software testing but also used in optimisation and categorisation.  This allow for the simplification of testing, there is no need to test every possible input, one of a group of input would suffice.
											
												<li>How Does Equivalence Partitioning Work in Python?</li>
											
												To implement equivalence partitioning in Python, you need a collection of objects to partition and an equivalence relation that defines how these objects are grouped.
											</ul>
											<p>The exam code uses the equivalence relation of lambda x, y: (x - y) % 4 == 0 with a data set of 100 numbers.  This relation determines that two numbers, x and y, are equivalent if their difference is divisible by 4. In other words, numbers with the same remainder when divided by 4 will be placed in the same equivalence class.</p>

											<p>Importance of Cyclomatic Complexity in Software Development</p>

											<p>Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) was introduced by Thomas McCave in 1976, it is a metric designed to measure the complexity of a programs control flow.  McCabe’s goal was to provide a quantitative way to assess how complicated a program logic was by counting the number of independent paths through the code.</p>
											
											<ul>
												Key Benefits of using CC
												<li>Maintainability:</li>
												Software with a high CC becomes increasingly more difficult to maintain or update.  Keeping the CC low promotes simplicity and allows for easier to maintain and update the code base and reduces the likelihood of bugs.
												<li>Testing Efficiency:</li>
													In testing, the higher the CC the more test cases are needed to fully test a piece of software. By reducing the CC, the testing is simplified ensuring all paths can be tested.
												<li>Security:</li>
												The higher the CC the easier it is to include complexities that can lead, and make harder find, security vulnerabilities.
											</ul>

											<p>In secure software development, it is crucial to keep Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) low. This helps maintain code simplicity, ensuring that all execution paths are thoroughly tested and not overlooked. Additionally, low CC makes the code easier to maintain and update, reducing the risk of introducing new errors or vulnerabilities.</p>

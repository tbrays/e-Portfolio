												<p><b>UML and Secure Software Development</b></p>
												<p>The Open Web Application Security Project, or OSWAP, is a non-profit organisation founded in 2001 (OWASP, N.D.)  Its main goal is to help highlight vulnerabilities with website, in an effort to prevent breaches in security.</p>
												<p>In the OSWAP Top 10 list published in 2021, Broken Access Control is the number one vulnerability (OWASP, N.D.)  This is often down to developer miss configuration of the access controls.  A specific instance of this is Insure Direct Object Reference, or IDOR.  It allows users, with little or no expertise, to access information for which they do not have privileges for.  If an e-commerce site uses order IDs directly in URLs without implementing proper authorization checks, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to view or modify other users’ orders. By simply manipulating the order ID in the URL, the attacker might gain access to confidential information or alter the order details of other customers, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.</p>
												<p>“It is a common practice for practitioners to draw the system architecture as a structural component or class diagram in order to represent the relationships between the subsystems.” (Pillai, A. B., 2017)</p>
												<p>Unified Modelling Language, or UML, is modelling language that allows the visualisation of a system.  It can show software or hardware systems and is used throughout the SDLC.  It was adopted by the Object Management Group, or OMG, in 2007 and is now maintained and developed by the OMG. UML has two main sections, Structural diagrams and Behavioural diagrams.  (UoEO, N.D.)</p>

												<div class="row">
													<div class="col-6">
														<p>Structural diagrams:
															<ul>
																<li>Class Diagram,</li>
																<li>Object Diagram,</li> 
																<li>Component Diagram,</li> 
																<li>Composite Structure Diagram,</li> 
																<li>Deployment Diagram,</li> 
																<li>Package Diagram.</li>
															</ul>
														</p>
													</div>
													<div class="col-6">
														<p>Behavioural Diagrams:

																<li>UseState Diagram,</li>
																<li>UseInteraction Overview Diagram,</li> 
																<li>UseTiming Diagram.</li>
															</ul>
														</p>
													</div>
												</div>

												<p>In developing an application, several UML diagrams are particularly valuable. The Use Case Diagram is essential for capturing high level functional requirements and interactions between users and the system. The Class Diagram provides a clear definition of the static structure, detailing the classes, attributes, methods, and their relationships within the data model. The Sequence Diagram is crucial for illustrating the detailed interactions and the sequence of messages exchanged operations, ensuring that the process flow is well-understood. The Activity Diagram helps visualize the workflows and processes involved in various operations, offering insights into the sequence of activities and decision points necessary for efficient execution.</p>

											<p>Hi Tim,</p>
											<p>Thank you for sharing your knowledge on OWASP vulnerabilities! I agree with your emphasis on Broken Access Control, highlighted as the top vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10 list. If a company does not configure access controls, like Insure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), it can lead to significant security breaches. Your example of an e-Commerce site using order IDs directly in URLs without proper authorisation checks definitely illustrates this risk. Your discussion on Unified Modelling Language (UML) is also spot-on. UML diagrams are invaluable in identifying potential security risks.</p>
											<p>To prevent these vulnerabilities, secure coding practices and regular training for developers are essential. Implementing robust authorisation models, leveraging security frameworks, conducting regular code reviews, and security audits are also crucial for early vulnerability detection. By integrating these measures into the Secure Development Life Cycle, organisations can certainly enhance security and protect user data from unauthorised access.</p>
											<p>Thank you for your submission!</p>

										<p>In this unit I learned about the fundamentals of software development methodologies.  Specifically, waterfall and Agile, while waterfall is an original concept it is outdated and Agile has gained popularity.  Its flexibility allows for faster and better development, however it can be a challenge to maintain consistent security practices across sprints.  This highlighted the necessity of planning security measure early in the development and adhering to them across teams.</p>

												<p>In this discussion, I have chosen to explore Broken Access Control (BAC), which has become the number one vulnerability exploited by cybercriminals today (OWASP, 2021). BAC occurs when restrictions on authenticated users are not implemented correctly, allowing attackers to access unauthorised data and cause serious security breaches (MITRE, 2021). This can allow cybercriminals to take control of user’s accounts, access sensitive information and compromise an entire website by changing admin logins.</p> 
											
												<p>The following UML Sequence Diagram illustrates a serious example where BAC allows an attacker to access the admin panel and take control of the website:</p>
											
												<p>In this scenario, the admin panel URL is protected by a simple URL path check, not proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Therefore, a regular user, User B, discovers the URL of the admin panel through either simple guesswork or more advanced software engineering skills. For example, it could be as simple as adding “/admin” to the end of the URL: https://example.com/admin.</p>
											
												<p>The application does not have robust access controls in place to verify that only users with admin privileges can access this admin URL. As a result, User B gains unauthorised access to the admin functionality, allowing them to view all user accounts, change passwords and permissions of other users, delete user accounts or even change administrator passwords. This clearly leads to a severe breach of system security and data privacy (Pillai, 2017). Therefore, as a solution, it is advisable for the website to implement strong authentication mechanisms, ensuring only users with valid admin credentials can access the admin panel (Gupta et al., 2022). </p>
											
												<p>In the above diagram, the application employs authorisation checks that verify whether the authenticated user has the required administrative role before allowing access to admin functionality. Any attempts by non-admin users to access the admin panel are logged, and appropriate security measures are taken (e.g., alerts to system administrators), as suggested by Kellezi et al., (2021). In the resolved scenario, the application ensures that only properly authenticated and authorised users can access critical administrative features, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorised access and potential system compromise.</p>

										<p>Hi, I also covered Broken Access Control. This is a large category of vulnerabilities, and you have provided a concise and accurate definition. The scenario where a user discovers an admin panel through simple URL path manipulation is a very realistic example. It demonstrates how easily BAC can be exploited, by attackers, when proper access controls are not implemented.</p>
										<p>You have discussed consequences of Broken Access Control and have mentioned unauthorised access and system compromise. Expanding this by mentioning wider issues such as potential financial losses, reputational damage, or legal implications, would strengthen your argument for the need to address this particular security issue.</p>
										<p>It is great to see that you included a potential mitigation strategy for this attack. Ensuring that appropriate security settings are in place is crucial and can be reinforced through training as part of an organisation's policy.</p>
										<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts on Broken Access Control.</p>

												<p>The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation publishes the “Top 10 Web Application Security Risks” to draw attention to the most important risks that are a fundamental part of application development (OWASP Foundation, 2024). According to the top 10 for 2021, OWASP Foundation (2024) identifies in the fourth position the vulnerability of “Insecure Design”.</p>
												<p>Insecure design emphasises on risks around mistakes made during the software design and the software architecture that can be expressed as “missing or ineffective control design” (OWASP Foundation, 2021). More broadly speaking, insecure design pertains to the practice of developing software solutions where the design of the system does not adhere to secure design patterns and best-practice architectural methodologies. This results to the creation of weaknesses which a bad actor could abuse.</p>
												<p>One of the example scenarios for insecure design offered by the OWASP Foundation (2021) is one where the design of the cinema booking system has a vulnerability in its activity flow which could potentially allow a bad actor to abuse it and lead to major loss of earnings. Below, I created two flow charts that depict the decision sequence based on this scenario, one with an insecure design flaw and another with a safeguard against that flaw.</p>
												<p>The first figure features the steps leading to a particular weakness relating to insecure design. Namely, bad actors could potentially flood the booking system with free booking reservations each one made for tickets less than a certain threshold (15) and not turn up in the venue to purchase the reserved tickets. The problematic control flow is highlighted in red colour.</p>
												<p>In the second figure, the design of the system includes a safeguard against abusing the booking system by enforcing that a deposit is requested regardless of the number of tickets in the reservations. This change in the activity flow (highlighted in green colour) means that it would no longer be free for any bad actors to make artificial reservations.</p>
												<p>According to Revniuk et. al. (2024), the insecure design vulnerability arises from inadequate threat modelling performed during the software design phase. The OWASP Foundation (2021) advocates for more threat modelling as one of the key steps developers should follow in guarding against the risk of insecure design. By utilising UML diagrams, the developers of the software solution can visualise all potential activity flows and identify risks or vulnerabilities found in their proposed design. Flowcharts and activity diagrams can be used as means of producing threat modelling analysis for modelling the system, identifying weak points and developing countermeasures.</p>

											<p>Hi, you gave a detailed describe of what insecure design entails and why it is a significant concern. The cinema booking system scenario provides a practical example. It demonstrates how insecure design can lead to real world problems and illustrates the potential financial impact of such vulnerabilities.</p>

										<p>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.</p>
										<p>“Human risk is today’s biggest Cybersecurity gap and remains largely unaddressed.” (Mimecast, 2024). Human error is the largest growing cyber security threat today, most of these could be mitigated through education. From ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 the following are five key concepts to managing the risk.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>1.	Access Control (3.1):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">Access control makes sure that only authorised personnel should have access to specific systems and information. Having and enforcing strict access control can help to mitigate this security risk. A regular review and updates of the policy helps to enhance security further.</li>
											<li>2. Information Security Policy (3.5):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">Information Security Policy should clearly outline acceptable use, security practices, and the consequences of violations. Training sessions should be conducted to ensure understand and adhere to these policies.</li> 
											<li>3. Security Awareness, Education, and Training (3.13):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">These programs should include training on recognising phishing attempts, proper data handling procedures, and the importance of reporting suspicious activities. Educated employees are more likely to follow best practices.</li>
											<li>4. Incident Management (3.8):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">An Incident Management process ensures that insider threats are found and addressed. Users should know how to report potential security incidents, and there should be a clear protocol for investigating and responding to these reports.</li>
											<li>5. Monitoring (3.10):</li> 
											<li style="list-style-type: none;padding-bottom:5px;">Monitoring of systems and user activities allows detection of suspicious behaviour. These tools can log and analyse user actions, flagging anomalies that may show insider threats. Regular audits of these logs can help in finding patterns that suggest malicious intent or negligent behaviour.</li>
										</ul>

										<p>As cyber threats evolve, and attacks become more sophisticated, human error stays the largest threat. This points to a need for continued and enhance education to manage insider risk.</p>

											<p>The initial post focused on Broken Access Control (BAC) in particular Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) as highlighted in the OWASP Top 10 list (OWASP, 2021). It also discussed the importance of Unified Modelling Language (UML) in secure software development. UML diagrams such as Sequence and Use Case diagrams play a key role in identifying security vulnerabilities early in the development process, making them crucial tools for identifying and addressing security issues to help build more secure systems.</p>
											<p>Peer reviews agreed on the focus on BAC and the need for secure coding practices and strong authentication. One peer added value by using a UML Sequence Diagram to show how weak access controls could allow unauthorized users to access admin-level features (Petchey, 2024). This example highlighted the risks of BAC and the need for regular security audits and developer training.</p>
											<p>Concepts from the course units, such as continuous security monitoring and the use of secure coding frameworks, reinforced the ideas in the initial post. The units also stressed how UML helps visualize system structures and identify vulnerabilities, supporting the original argument that UML diagrams are crucial in secure software development. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and ISO/IEC 27000 standards highlighted the need for a structured security approach (ISO, 2022). Section 3 stressed the value of an information security management system (ISMS) and discusses the human risk factors, reinforced the importance of developer training to address vulnerabilities, aligning with peer feedback on security audits and training.</p>
											<p>Overall, the discussion strengthened the understanding of UML’s role in secure software development, especially in dealing with vulnerabilities like BAC. Insights from peers emphasized the need for secure coding, strong authentication, and authorization, helping to shape a more security focused approach for future projects. This ensures vulnerabilities are addressed throughout the Software Development Life Cycle.</p>

											<p><b>What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</b></p>
											<ul>
												<li><b>Memory Safety:</b> Languages that prevent buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and memory leaks are considered more secure. This feature is crucial in preventing vulnerabilities like buffer overflow attacks, which are common in languages like C and C++.</li>
												<li><b>Type Safety:</b> Strongly typed languages can prevent unintended data manipulation by enforcing strict rules on how data types are used. Type mismatches can lead to vulnerabilities, and strongly typed languages ensure that variables are used correctly.</li>
												<li><b>Error Handling:</b> Secure languages provide robust mechanisms to handle errors and exceptions gracefully. Proper error handling can prevent applications from crashing or entering a vulnerable state due to unexpected inputs or conditions.</li>
												<li><b>Sandboxing and Permission Control:</b> Languages like Java that provide built-in sandboxing ensure that code executes in a restricted environment, preventing unauthorized access to system resources.</li>
												<li><b>Compiler/Interpreter Security:</b> A secure language should have a well-tested compiler or interpreter that doesn’t introduce vulnerabilities during code execution.</li>
												<li><b>Standard Library Security:</b> A programming language's standard library should be secure, with well-vetted functions that avoid unsafe practices like the use of insecure cryptography algorithms or unchecked input.</li>
												<li><b>Concurrency Handling:</b> As many modern applications rely on parallel processing, languages that handle concurrency securely can prevent race conditions and data corruption.</li>
												<li><b>Community and Support:</b> A large, active community and regular updates help ensure that vulnerabilities are quickly discovered and patched.</li>
											</ul>
										
											<p><b>Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</b></p>
											<p>Python can be considered relatively secure but with some limitations. It manages memory automatically through its garbage collection mechanism, eliminating the need for direct pointer manipulation, thus reducing the risk of buffer overflows and memory-related vulnerabilities compared to languages like C.</p> 
											<p>Python is dynamically typed, meaning it doesn’t enforce type checking at compile-time, which can lead to issues when types are mixed unintentionally, though its runtime checks provide a layer of safety by throwing exceptions when types are misused.Python’s robust error-handling system, using try-except blocks, allows for efficient management of errors without crashing programs.</p> 
											<p>Python's interpreter is regularly updated to patch known vulnerabilities, but being an interpreted language, it is susceptible to injection attacks, although proper coding practices can mitigate these risks. The standard library is extensive and generally secure, though certain modules can introduce security risks if mishandled. Secure cryptographic libraries such as hashlib and ssl provide secure communication.Python benefits from a large community and frequent updates, ensuring that known vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.</p>
												
											
											<p><b>Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</b></p>
											<p>While Python is a highly flexible, general-purpose language, it is not better than C for creating operating systems for several reasons. Operating systems require low-level hardware interaction such as memory management, device drivers, and system calls, which C handles efficiently by providing direct access to memory and system resources. Python abstracts these details, which simplifies development but limits its ability to perform efficiently at the low level required for operating systems. </p>
											<p>As an interpreted language, Python is slower than compiled languages like C, and since operating systems need to be highly optimized for performance, C remains superior in terms of speed and resource management. Python’s higher-level abstractions could accelerate development for components that do not require tight resource control. </p>
											<p>In conclusion, while Python offers ease of development, C is far more suitable for operating system development due to its performance, low-level access, and mature ecosystem.</p>
										</div>
	
										<div class="section colour2 col-12">
											<p><b>Team Contributions</b></p>
											<p>One team member agreed with the conclusion but emphasized the importance of memory safety when discussing security, especially when comparing Python and C. They also suggested that Rust might be a better option for secure OS development due to its balance of performance and memory safety features.</p>

<p>Another team member pointed out Python's limitations in low-level system interaction, especially when compared to languages like C, which offers direct memory and hardware access. They argued that Python’s high-level abstractions, while improving ease of development, prevent it from being suitable for critical tasks like device driver development or kernel programming, where precise control over hardware is required. This lack of low-level access makes Python less efficient for performance-critical operations that are essential in operating system development.</p>

													<p>What happens?</p> 
													<p>When the code is run, it will ask for a name and store it into the buffer. Once entered the buffer is then printed to the screen.</p> 
													<p>The code is designed to handle only 7 characters, with the last being the null terminator. When an input of less than or equal to seven character is provided the code works as intended but if more than seven characters are entered then the code returns an error of stack smashing.</p>
													<p>Stack smashing occurs when a buffer overflow overwrites data on the stack, particularly the return address or other critical variables. This can cause the program to crash or lead to security vulnerabilities where malicious code can be injected and executed.</p>

This would allow the maximum number of characters to read from the input string to be set. This means that it would never try to enter more than the buffer can take. </p>

											<p>ReDOS or Regular Expression Denial of Service is an attack that exploits the inefficiencies of regular expressions.  During a ReDOS attack a specifically crafted input is used to exploit the vulnerable regular expressions. These poorly optimised expressions are known as ‘Evil Regex’.</p>
											<p>For example, the regex pattern (a+)+ is used to match sequences of one or more 'a' characters, grouped in one or more repetitions. While it may seem useful for matching strings like "a", "aa", "aaa", or "aaaa", it is problematic because it allows excessive backtracking.</p>

												<p>The theoretical maximum is tied to the recursion limit set by python, this can be retrieved by importing sys and using sys.getrecursionlimit().

											<p>Python equivalence partitioning</p>

											<ul>
												<li>What is Equivalence partitioning?</li>
											
												This is a method use to categorise elements into groups, based on an equivalence relation, such as having the same remainder when divided by a number.
											
												<li>Why use it?</li>
											
												It is use primarily in software testing but also used in optimisation and categorisation.  This allow for the simplification of testing, there is no need to test every possible input, one of a group of input would suffice.
											
												<li>How Does Equivalence Partitioning Work in Python?</li>
											
												To implement equivalence partitioning in Python, you need a collection of objects to partition and an equivalence relation that defines how these objects are grouped.
											</ul>
											<p>The exam code uses the equivalence relation of lambda x, y: (x - y) % 4 == 0 with a data set of 100 numbers.  This relation determines that two numbers, x and y, are equivalent if their difference is divisible by 4. In other words, numbers with the same remainder when divided by 4 will be placed in the same equivalence class.</p>

											<p>Importance of Cyclomatic Complexity in Software Development</p>

											<p>Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) was introduced by Thomas McCave in 1976, it is a metric designed to measure the complexity of a programs control flow.  McCabe’s goal was to provide a quantitative way to assess how complicated a program logic was by counting the number of independent paths through the code.</p>
											
											<ul>
												Key Benefits of using CC
												<li>Maintainability:</li>
												Software with a high CC becomes increasingly more difficult to maintain or update.  Keeping the CC low promotes simplicity and allows for easier to maintain and update the code base and reduces the likelihood of bugs.
												<li>Testing Efficiency:</li>
													In testing, the higher the CC the more test cases are needed to fully test a piece of software. By reducing the CC, the testing is simplified ensuring all paths can be tested.
												<li>Security:</li>
												The higher the CC the easier it is to include complexities that can lead, and make harder find, security vulnerabilities.
											</ul>

											<p>In secure software development, it is crucial to keep Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) low. This helps maintain code simplicity, ensuring that all execution paths are thoroughly tested and not overlooked. Additionally, low CC makes the code easier to maintain and update, reducing the risk of introducing new errors or vulnerabilities.</p>

VeraCrypt offers enhanced security features and ongoing support, making it a more reliable choice for encryption needs (VeraCrypt, 2024).</p>
													<p>The main weaknesses of TrueCrypt include the lack of maintenance and insecure key management. For users encrypting sensitive data, such as bank details, these flaws could lead to data exposure, reinforcing the need for better-maintained encryption solutions.</p>

											<p>Your analysis of TrueCrypt is clear and well-structured, effectively highlighting its vulnerabilities and the reasons for recommending alternatives like VeraCrypt. The flow of the content makes it easy to follow the reasoning behind the conclusions, particularly the emphasis on the discontinued support and the security risks this presents.</p>

											<p>The ontology design is very useful in visualising TrueCrypt's weaknesses. It provides an understandable and effective visual representation of the issues discussed, making the technical aspects more accessible. </p>

											<p>I think that your ontology design is very well planned and presented and you make a good suggestion for how to address these vulnerabilities in general.</p>

											<p>I think that, in an attempt to remedy information leaking, the designers should have implemented better memory management and resource handling, as the system is vulnerable to paging out sensitive data (Junestam & Guigo, 2014). A suggested solution is to pool sensitive data into one memory location so that it can be locked down (Junestam & Guigo, 2014); in your summary post, perhaps you could include specific suggested solutions to each issue, as taken from Junestam & Guigo's (2014) report.</p>

											<p>Your analysis of TrueCrypt's vulnerabilities gives a really clear picture of why this once-popular tool is no longer recommended. Your use of the cryptanalysis by Junestam and Guigo (2014) supports the developers' claim about TrueCrypt's insecurity.</p>

											<p>I'd like to expand on two concerns you've raised:</p>

											<p>Lack of Maintenance: As you've pointed out, TrueCrypt's end-of-life status in 2014 means no patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. This is worrying in the contiually evolving cybersecurity landscape. Without updates, TrueCrypt users are relying on outdated security measures, leaving their data increasingly vulnerable as new attack vectors emerge.</p>

											<p>Side-Channel Attack Vulnerabilities: Your mention of potential side-channel attacks is excellent I thought and a really important point. These vulnerabilities could quite easily allow attackers to extract cryptographic keys by analysing physical implementation rather than the cryptographic algorithm itself. For instance, timing attacks or power analysis could compromise the entire encryption system without directly breaking the cryptographic protocol.</p>

											<p>Your recommendation of VeraCrypt as an alternative is sound, given its active maintenance and resolution of many TrueCrypt vulnerabilities. However, I'd just mention that transitioning from TrueCrypt to VeraCrypt is not simply a matter of switching software or providers. Users would need to consider the process of migrating existing encrypted data, which could potentially expose information during the transition if not handled properly.</p>

											<p>All in all, your analysis serves as a strong reminder of the importance of using actively maintained security tools.</p>

											<p>The previously very popular TrueCrypt encryption tool was discontinued in 2014 with its anonymous developers stating that it "may contain unfixed security issues" (TrueCrypt, 2014). The cryptanalysis by Junestam & Guigo (2014) is not clear proof of the insecurity of TrueCrypt but describes several concerns. The primary issue is the lack of updates, leaving the software vulnerable to evolving threats and improvements in cryptographic attacks. TrueCrypt still relies on outdated encryption methods, such as AES and Serpent, which can eventually be compromised by newer cryptographic techniques. </p>
											<p>I would not recommend using TrueCrypt for today's date regarding secure storage. Although no critical flaws have been proven for the existing encryption, discontinuation of updates and maintenance is a very considerable security issue. I would suggest to use alternative solutions available, such as VeraCrypt, that build on top of TrueCrypt and mitigate most security issues while still actively maintained. If, despite these issues, someone must use TrueCrypt, I would do so with the strongest of caveats: limit its use to non-sensitive data and realize that vulnerabilities will be found in the future that will not be patched.</p>

											<p>You provided a clear and well structured analysis of possible risks of using TrueCrypt in today's environment. Your discussion about the discontinuation of the tool and absence of updates is very important with respect to software security. The mentioning of cryptographic methods such as AES and Serpent has shown quite well the limitations of obsolete methods of encryption.</p>

											<p>One suggestion for further improvement might be to elaborate on the specific issues with AES and Serpent as to why they are now considered obsolete. I liked how you suggested VeraCrypt as a secure alternative, but you could have elaborated a bit more on why VeraCrypt is better.</p>

											<p>Overall, your analysis is well balanced and highlights the importance of keeping security tools updated.</p>

											<p>The cryptanalysis by Junestam and Guigo (2014) does not conclusively disprove the TrueCrypt developers' statement, “Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues” (TrueCrypt, 2014). It confirms that the core encryption algorithms (AES, Serpent, and Twofish) are secure and that no critical vulnerabilities were identified in their analysis. However, it also acknowledges that:</p>

											<ol>
												<li>TrueCrypt lacks certain modern security features, such as authenticated encryption.</li>
												<li>Potential vulnerabilities in key management and physical security exist.</li>
												<li>The software’s discontinuation means no future security updates, making it vulnerable to emerging threats.</li>
											</ol>

											<p>I would not recommend TrueCrypt to a friend as a secure storage environment. Given the known vulnerabilities and the fact that the software has been discontinued, it is no longer considered a reliable or secure option. The potential for unpatched vulnerabilities and the lack of ongoing security updates make it a risky choice.</p>

											<p><b>Ontology Design</b></p>
											<p>The attached ontology design captures the weaknesses of TrueCrypt and organises them according to their severity.</p>

											<p><b>TrueCrypt Weaknesses</b></p>
											<ul>
												<li>High Severity</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Discontinued Support: TrueCrypt is no longer maintained, meaning future vulnerabilities will not be patched. Users relying on it for sensitive data may be vulnerable to new threats.</li>
													<li>Potential Hidden Vulnerabilities: The authors themselves warned of possible unresolved security issues. Users cannot trust that their data is completely secure.</li>
												</ul>
											</ul>
											
											<ul>
												<li>Medium Severity</li>

													<li>Lack of Security Audits: Although the algorithms used are widely trusted, the overall codebase may contain undiscovered bugs. Users may face vulnerabilities in other parts of the software.</li>
												</ul>
											</ul>

											<ul>
												<li>Low Severity</li>

												<p></p>You broke down the security issues surrounding TrueCrypt and made it clear what the critical concerns were with the discontinuation. I appreciated how you underlined specific vulnerabilities in that context, such as the lack of modern security features and possible key management issues. Both are good points to explain why TrueCrypt is no longer a reliable option when it comes to secure storage.

												<p>It would be even more useful if there were a bit more explanation regarding the differences between TrueCrypt and its modern alternatives. For example, you can talk about VeraCrypt or BitLocker and how they patch the problems in TrueCrypt.</p>

												<p>Using the ontology design to organize weaknesses in TrueCrypt in order of severity was a great way to visually see the risks.</p>

											<p>Faceted Data</p>
											<p>Faceted Data offers a structured approach to storing, managing and protecting sensitive data.  It divides the data into multiple groups or facets.  This approach also provides access controls for the data going toward an organisation complying with GDPR.</p>
											<p>Pros</p>

											<p>A Balanced Future with Monolithic and Modular Architectures.</p>

											<p>There has been a lot of discussion around the statement “Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future.” While microservices and microkernels are widely used, I believe that the future is a balance between these newer approaches and the proven monolithic architecture.</p>
											<p>Monolithic systems such as the Windows NT architecture evolved from a primarily monolithic design into a hybrid kernel. This design has proven effective in delivering both performance and stability. Microsoft adopted this hybrid approach to combine the efficiency of monolithic systems with some modular features, like device drivers. This shows that even modern large-scale systems continue to depend on monolithic kernels for core functions. Windows has been structured as a mostly monolithic kernel with certain modular elements, demonstrating a balanced approach between the two architectures (Russinovich & Solomon, 2009).</p>
												<p>Microkernels and microservices are particularly useful in distributed systems and embed environments, as these systems need to be more flexible and allow for scalability.  This does, however, introduce overheads as the code becomes more complex, specifically the communication between the modules.</p>
											<p>In conclusion I disagree with the original statements.  The success of both monolithic and modular approaches shows that both approaches will continue to exist.</p>

											<p>Secure Software Development (Computer Science)</p>
											<p>Assignment 1: Development Team Project: Design Document</p>

											<p>Group 1</p>

											<p>Knowledge & Understanding of the Topic/Issues (25%): The knowledge and understanding of the topic/issue has been demonstrated well particularly focusing on the requirement of having and managing a School Learning Management System. The students have demonstrated good level of awareness of the security-related challenges of the domain including the awareness of the software features that can be used to enable a secure solution. There are evidences of using Class Diagram, Use Case, and Sequence diagram, which looks appropriate but however, was hard to read texts, which must have been looked at. </p>
												
											<p>Presentation and Communication Skills (Depth of solution design communicated) (30%): To me, overall presentation and communication skills are very good. No noticeable issues have been noted throughout. </p>

											<p>Criticality (Awareness of the competing decisions that may support the system design) (25%): It can be said that the solution proposal and methodology provides good level of awareness of the competing decisions that may support the system design including tools and technologies, encryption and testing libraries, and class diagram, use case and sequence diagram. However, the students could have addressed pros and cons in a more critical and in-depth way. </p>

											<p>Structure and Presentation (Document design, document contents) (10%): To me, there are no significant issues related to the document design and document contents except UML design, which could have paid more attention to make all the texts readable. </p>

											<p>Use of relevant sources (10%): It can be said that the students have used a handful amount of academic sources, which are mostly up to date. However, some of the sources have been found improper in terms of their format, which must have been looked at. I strongly suggest students to follow the university’s Harvard Referencing guidelines.</p>

												<p>End of Module Assignment – Feedback</p>

												<p>Knowledge & Understanding: The student has brilliantly produced a reflective report where the student has started his journey from the group formation and provided emotions, feelings, challenges, and way to deal with them. The best part from the student was integrity, which was commendable. However, one of the areas that student could have improved on is to make it clear that how did they overcome any specific challenge and how those solutions helped them on their individual learning or experience. The source code is fully available on GitHub, which was commendable. The whole reflection was based on the Rolfe et al (2001) model, which shows that the student has clear understanding of the context.</p>

												<p>Evidence of Artefact: The student has nicely maintained an e-Portfolio, where nicely created a branch of the module and produced in detailed learning outcomes for each units. The overall design of the artefact was excellent. No complicated way of designing the artefact is evident. To me, the student has done a brilliant job here.</p>

												<p>Academic Integrity & Uses of Sources: It has been noted that the student has four percentage of similarity, which is great. Although it is a reflective piece of work, but still the student has used some academic sources, and all the sources are most up to date.</p>

											<h3>Project Failures</h3>
											<p>Please read the Agrawal et al. (2024) paper and then answer the following questions.</p>
											<h4>Question 1</h4>
											<p>What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?</p>
											<p><b>Poor Communication</b></p>
											<p>Ineffective communication between stakeholders, users and internal teams is a fundamental cause of project failure. It leads to unclear requirements, misaligned expectations and delayed recognition of problems. Agrawal, Walia and Anu (2024) identify weak stakeholder engagement and lack of top management commitment, both of which stem from breakdowns in communication.</p>
											<p><b>Scope Creep</b></p>
											<p>The uncontrolled expansion of project objectives without proper evaluation of time, cost or risk, introduces instability and inefficiency. According to Agrawal, Walia and Anu (2024) scope creep is linked to poor project selection, weak alignment with organisational strategy and the absence of defined performance measures.</p>
											<p><b>Insufficient Technical Expertise</b></p>
											<p>Teams that lack the necessary technical competencies struggle to implement effective, reliable solutions. Agrawal, Walia and Anu (2024) highlight this as a recurring issue, citing inadequate training and underdeveloped technical capabilities as major contributors to failure.</p>
											<h4>Question 2</h4>
											<p>Provide two examples of project failures that support your choices.</p>
											<p><b>The Day Before (2023) Fntastic</b></p>
											<p>This project failed primarily due to communication failures and unrestrained scope changes. Marketed as a multiplayer MMO survival game, the final release lacked core features and instead resembled a limited shooter. The shift in the game’s design was not communicated clearly to the public or even within the development team. Features shown in promotional material were significantly scaled back or omitted, demonstrating a clear case of scope creep. The game was withdrawn from sale within one week of release and the development studio closed shortly afterwards (Harrold, 2023).</p>
											<p><b>Bowman Radio System UK Ministry of Defence</b>
											<p>Intended to replace the outdated Clansman system, the Bowman project encountered repeated delays and significant cost escalation due to uncontrolled scope expansion. Additional technical requirements, integration demands and expanded operational expectations were introduced during the project without change management. This resulted in delivery well behind schedule, at a much higher cost than initially planned and with persistent performance issues. The system was widely criticised for being unreliable and overly complex (National Audit Office, 2006).</p>

											<p>I enjoyed reading your post, particularly your discussion of The Day Before video game project and its apparent scope creep. This seems reminiscent of No Man’s Sky initial release which, as you no doubt know, was widely criticised for not having lived up to expectations. Promises of expansive worlds and hints at massively multiplayer online game features were in stark contrast to the reality of what was released - sparse planetary exploration with repetitive ‘grinding’ tasks within a lonely gaming experience in which there was very little chance of interaction with other players. Both projects appear to have failed due to what Agrawal, Walia & Anu, (2024: 6) would deem an ‘organisational influence error’ that, as you say, seems to be a result of scope creep.</p>

											<p>Despite their initial failings however, Hello Games seems to have turned this project around, adding many free feature updates since its 2016 release. This has seen the game’s Steam score rise from being ‘overwhelmingly negative’ in 2016 to ‘overwhelmingly positive’ in 2024, following 35 free content updates (Wales, 2024). It could be argued that this success would not have been possible without the initial lessons learnt from failure i.e. a need to listen to the gaming community and hold their requirements in the highest regard – something that Midler & Alochet (2024: 187) would deem a ‘phoenix type project’.</p>

											<p>It would be interesting to understand the reasons behind Fntastic’s subsequent closure and why they were unable to follow in Hello Games’ footsteps and become a ‘phoenix type project’ (Midler & Alochet, 2024: 187).</p>

											<p>Within their paper, Agrawal, Walia & Anu (2024) propose a Software Design Error Taxonomy (SDET), for use as a practical tool to enable the early identification of errors within the software development lifecycle. Within this paper, an error is defined as the ‘…root cause of software design faults and failures.’ (Agrawal, Walia & Anu, 2024: 2). Such errors have the potential to lead to faults - ‘the manifestation of an error recorded in a software artifact.’ (Agrawal, Walia & Anu, 2024: 2) - and faults can, in turn, result in a failure: ‘the incorrect execution of a software system…’ (Agrawal, Walia & Anu, 2024: 2).</p>

											<p>The early identification of errors can help to avoid the more costly consequences of allowing these to develop into faults and failures (Agrawal, Walia & Anu, 2024, Durham, 2021). Within their literature review, Agrawal, Walia & Anu (2024) highlight three key software design errors that have been commonly reported: Knowledge gap errors, organisational errors, and human cognition errors. These error types can therefore be seen as the three most common reasons for software project failure.</p>

											<p>Knowledge gap errors can lead to estimation and analysis failures including underestimation of design time, project management, communication and testing - the IBM System 360 project suffering at the hands of such failures (Milward, 2025). Other failures that could be attributed to knowledge gap errors are skills and competency failures that include poor design, poor implementation and poorly tested solutions (Milward, 2025). The European Space Agency Ariane 5 rocket disaster fell victim to this failure type, wherein testing failed to pick up on a software error from a piece of redundant code left over from previous iterations of the software (Gleick, 1996).</p>

											<p>Organisational errors can lead to planning-related failures, including scheduling issues, problems with procurement and attempts to implement large changes too quickly (Milward, 2025), for example the US FAA Advanced Automation System failures (Bar Yam, 2003). Organisational errors can also cause communication and engagement-related failures, including expectation management (Milward, 2025). This was evident in the EDS-BSkyB CRM project, in which the customer (BSkyB) claimed that the supplier (EDS) submitted a bid when they knew they didn’t have the skills or resources to deliver, whereas the supplier claimed that the customer had unrealistic expectations (Collins, 2008).</p>

											<p>Human cognition errors, in which stress and fatigue are the root cause, can cause quality-related failures that include a lack of testing and delivery management, which can lead to failures in the use of the system (Agrawal, Walia & Anu, 2024; Milward, 2025). The UK Government Tax Credit online system has seen such failings (Computing, 2008).  Additionally, from personal experience, the need to meet deadlines for programming assignments caused quality failures, including the exclusion of features such as a ‘back’ or ‘cancel’ option for navigation on certain command line menus; this resulted in the user having to enter an input even if the option was accidentally selected.</p>

											<p>I enjoyed reading your post, the real world examples you used worked well. The Ariane 5 case was a strong choice to show the impact of missed errors in testing. The BSkyB and EDS example also stood out as it shows how badly things can go wrong when there is poor communication between teams and unrealistic goals on both sides.</p>
											<p>I thought your point about human cognition errors was interesting too. I do not have much experience with software projects myself, but your personal example helped make that type of error more relatable. It is easy to see how stress or deadline pressure could lead to small mistakes that have a big impact, I see it in a lot of my students work when they are near deadlines.</p>
											<p>One thing I wondered was whether some of the errors could fall into more than one category. For example, if someone is not trained properly, that could be seen as both a knowledge gap and an organisational failure and even cause a cognitive failure. </p>
											<p>Overall, your post was clear, well supported by examples and easy to understand.</p>

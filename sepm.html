											<h2>Project Failures</h2>
											
											<p>Read the Agrawal et al. (2024) paper and then answer the following questions.</p>
											
											<h3>Question 1</h3>
											<p><strong>What are the three most common reasons for project failure?</strong></p>
											
											<div>
											  <p><strong>Poor Communication</strong><br>
											  Ineffective communication between stakeholders, users and internal teams causes unclear requirements, misaligned expectations and delayed recognition of problems. 
											  Agrawal, Walia and Anu (2024) identify weak stakeholder engagement and lack of top management commitment, both rooted in communication breakdowns.</p>
											
											  <p><strong>Scope Creep</strong><br>
											  Uncontrolled expansion of project objectives without evaluating time, cost or risk creates instability. 
											  Agrawal, Walia and Anu (2024) link scope creep to poor project selection, weak alignment with organisational strategy and undefined performance measures.</p>
											
											  <p><strong>Insufficient Technical Expertise</strong><br>
											  Teams without the required technical skills fail to deliver reliable solutions. 
											  Agrawal, Walia and Anu (2024) cite inadequate training and underdeveloped capabilities as major contributors to this failure.</p>
											</div>
											
											<h3>Question 2</h3>
											<p><strong>Provide two examples of project failures that support your choices.</strong></p>
											
											<div>
											  <p><strong>The Day Before (2023) – Fntastic</strong><br>
											  Failed due to communication breakdowns and scope creep. Promoted as an MMO survival game, the final product lacked key features and resembled a limited shooter. 
											  The shift in design was not communicated clearly to the public or internally. Features from promotional material were removed or reduced. 
											  The game was withdrawn from sale within one week and the studio shut down shortly after (Harrold, 2023).</p>
											
											  <p><strong>Bowman Radio System – UK Ministry of Defence</strong><br>
											  Intended to replace Clansman, the Bowman project suffered delays and cost overruns due to uncontrolled scope expansion. 
											  New technical and operational requirements were added without change control. The final product was late, over budget and criticised for being unreliable and complex (National Audit Office, 2006).</p>

											<p>I enjoyed reading your post, particularly your discussion of The Day Before video game project and its apparent scope creep. This seems reminiscent of No Man’s Sky initial release which, as you no doubt know, was widely criticised for not having lived up to expectations. Promises of expansive worlds and hints at massively multiplayer online game features were in stark contrast to the reality of what was released - sparse planetary exploration with repetitive ‘grinding’ tasks within a lonely gaming experience in which there was very little chance of interaction with other players. Both projects appear to have failed due to what Agrawal, Walia & Anu, (2024: 6) would deem an ‘organisational influence error’ that, as you say, seems to be a result of scope creep.</p>

											<p>Despite their initial failings however, Hello Games seems to have turned this project around, adding many free feature updates since its 2016 release. This has seen the game’s Steam score rise from being ‘overwhelmingly negative’ in 2016 to ‘overwhelmingly positive’ in 2024, following 35 free content updates (Wales, 2024). It could be argued that this success would not have been possible without the initial lessons learnt from failure i.e. a need to listen to the gaming community and hold their requirements in the highest regard – something that Midler & Alochet (2024: 187) would deem a ‘phoenix type project’.</p>

											<p>It would be interesting to understand the reasons behind Fntastic’s subsequent closure and why they were unable to follow in Hello Games’ footsteps and become a ‘phoenix type project’ (Midler & Alochet, 2024: 187).</p>

											<p>Within their paper, Agrawal, Walia & Anu (2024) propose a Software Design Error Taxonomy (SDET), for use as a practical tool to enable the early identification of errors within the software development lifecycle. Within this paper, an error is defined as the ‘…root cause of software design faults and failures.’ (Agrawal, Walia & Anu, 2024: 2). Such errors have the potential to lead to faults - ‘the manifestation of an error recorded in a software artifact.’ (Agrawal, Walia & Anu, 2024: 2) - and faults can, in turn, result in a failure: ‘the incorrect execution of a software system…’ (Agrawal, Walia & Anu, 2024: 2).</p>

											<p>The early identification of errors can help to avoid the more costly consequences of allowing these to develop into faults and failures (Agrawal, Walia & Anu, 2024, Durham, 2021). Within their literature review, Agrawal, Walia & Anu (2024) highlight three key software design errors that have been commonly reported: Knowledge gap errors, organisational errors, and human cognition errors. These error types can therefore be seen as the three most common reasons for software project failure.</p>

											<p>Knowledge gap errors can lead to estimation and analysis failures including underestimation of design time, project management, communication and testing - the IBM System 360 project suffering at the hands of such failures (Milward, 2025). Other failures that could be attributed to knowledge gap errors are skills and competency failures that include poor design, poor implementation and poorly tested solutions (Milward, 2025). The European Space Agency Ariane 5 rocket disaster fell victim to this failure type, wherein testing failed to pick up on a software error from a piece of redundant code left over from previous iterations of the software (Gleick, 1996).</p>

											<p>Organisational errors can lead to planning-related failures, including scheduling issues, problems with procurement and attempts to implement large changes too quickly (Milward, 2025), for example the US FAA Advanced Automation System failures (Bar Yam, 2003). Organisational errors can also cause communication and engagement-related failures, including expectation management (Milward, 2025). This was evident in the EDS-BSkyB CRM project, in which the customer (BSkyB) claimed that the supplier (EDS) submitted a bid when they knew they didn’t have the skills or resources to deliver, whereas the supplier claimed that the customer had unrealistic expectations (Collins, 2008).</p>

											<p>Human cognition errors, in which stress and fatigue are the root cause, can cause quality-related failures that include a lack of testing and delivery management, which can lead to failures in the use of the system (Agrawal, Walia & Anu, 2024; Milward, 2025). The UK Government Tax Credit online system has seen such failings (Computing, 2008).  Additionally, from personal experience, the need to meet deadlines for programming assignments caused quality failures, including the exclusion of features such as a ‘back’ or ‘cancel’ option for navigation on certain command line menus; this resulted in the user having to enter an input even if the option was accidentally selected.</p>

											<p>I enjoyed reading your post, the real world examples you used worked well. The Ariane 5 case was a strong choice to show the impact of missed errors in testing. The BSkyB and EDS example also stood out as it shows how badly things can go wrong when there is poor communication between teams and unrealistic goals on both sides.</p>
											<p>I thought your point about human cognition errors was interesting too. I do not have much experience with software projects myself, but your personal example helped make that type of error more relatable. It is easy to see how stress or deadline pressure could lead to small mistakes that have a big impact, I see it in a lot of my students work when they are near deadlines.</p>
											<p>One thing I wondered was whether some of the errors could fall into more than one category. For example, if someone is not trained properly, that could be seen as both a knowledge gap and an organisational failure and even cause a cognitive failure. </p>
											<p>Overall, your post was clear, well supported by examples and easy to understand.</p>

											<h3>Project Failures - Summary</h3>
											<p>In my original post, I argued that poor communication, shifting scope and limited technical skills often lead to project failure. Agrawal et al. (2024) support this view, linking these problems to weak stakeholder engagement and misalignment with organisational goals. I used The Day Before and the Bowman radio system to show how unclear requirements and unmanaged changes led to serious delivery issues.</p>
											<p>Edge (2025) expanded on this by comparing The Day Before with No Man’s Sky, which also launched with missing features and widespread user disappointment. He linked these problems to scope creep and organisational influence failures, consistent with Agrawal et al. (2024) analysis. However, unlike The Day Before, No Man’s Sky recovered over time. Through regular updates and direct player engagement, Hello Games regained user support. Todd described this as a "phoenix type project" where early failure created the conditions for long-term success (Midler & Alochet, 2024).</p>
												<p>Fntastic did not recover. After reading Todd’s reply, I investigated further. The Day Before was removed from sale within days of launch, and the studio announced its closure shortly after, citing a lack of funding (Game World Observer, 2023). The developers stated that the game had failed commercially and could not sustain the business. Techdirt (2023) reported that Fntastic’s shutdown came just one week after launch, and the studio deleted its online presence without addressing community concerns. There were no updates and no communication with the users. Unlike Hello Games, which actively responded to criticism, Fntastic withdrew completely and recovery was never attempted, let alone feasible.</p>
											<p>I wonder if success stories like No Man’s Sky have influenced the rise of Early Access. It allows studios to release a base version of a game and develop features alongside the player base, such as the release of Space Engineers 2. When done properly, it can build engagement and improve the final product.</p>

											<h3>Factors Affecting User Experience</h3>

											<p>User emotions play a big role in how people experience digital products, especially the first time they use them. First impressions are powerful, but they often do not reflect how users feel after spending more time with a product.</p>

											<p>Gu, Tang and Xue (2023) explored this in their study of the halo effect, where users rate a product’s usability more positively simply because it looks good. They found that this effect is strongest right after first use, but it fades within three days. I agree with their conclusion that this has big implications for user interface evaluation, waiting a few days before collecting feedback can lead to more accurate and realistic responses.</p>

											<p>Psychological research backs this up. Clean layouts and limited information help reduce cognitive load, which makes users feel more at ease and in control (Mărcuță and MoldStud Research Team, 2024). When a design looks clean, modern and well organised, users often assume it will be easy to use, even if the underlying functionality has flaws. So early feedback often reflects how the interface looks and feels, rather than how well it actually works.</p>

											<p>Visually appealing designs also tend to create positive emotions, which make users more forgiving early on (Thielsch and Hirschfeld, 2019). But there is a downside. When a product looks slick, users expect it to perform well. If it does not, those high expectations can quickly turn into disappointment (Bargas-Avila and Hornbæk, 2019).</p>

											<p>That is why I think Gu et al.'s point is useful. Delaying evaluation gives users time to see past the surface and form opinions based on real interaction. Attractive design can cover up problems at first, but it also raises expectations. Letting users settle in before asking for feedback leads to better data and better decisions in user interface research.</p>

											<p>This was one of the most engaging topics for me. The discussion on user experience and psychology allowed me to explore a subject I find genuinely interesting. It helped me think more critically about how users engage with interfaces beyond functionality. I also drew on past discussions with my own students about layout, colour choices and the use of shapes, which reinforced how design decisions can affect user perception and interaction.</p>

											<h3>Factors Affecting User Experience</h3>
											<p>In my original post, I discussed how first impressions of a user interface can be distorted by visual appeal, drawing on Gu, Tang and Xue’s (2023) research on the halo effect. Their findings showed that users initially rate usability more positively if a product looks good, but this effect fades within a few days. I argued that delaying usability evaluations leads to more accurate feedback, since initial impressions are often based more on aesthetics than actual performance.</p>
											<p>Edge (2025) reply pushed me to think more critically about how cognitive load influences that early impression. He introduced the distinction between Intrinsic and Extraneous Cognitive Load from Mărcuță and the MoldStud Research Team (2024), which helped me consider how perceived complexity might affect how users judge aesthetics. For example, if someone expects a task to be difficult, even a clean interface might feel overwhelming. I had not considered that users might be estimating their future cognitive effort when looking at a design for the first time.</p>
											<p>Millward (2025) added a practical angle, pointing out that many modern devices replicate familiar interfaces to reduce friction, like smartwatch displays mimicking analogue faces. That raised an important question for me: are design choices based on actual usability, or just what feels mentally comfortable? Combined, both replies made me reconsider how much of user experience is shaped by learned patterns and expectations, not just interface quality. It is not just about delaying feedback, it is also about understanding what shapes user judgement in the first place.</p>

											<p>This unit introduced code quality tools, including Python linters. I used Replit as my IDE and had some issues getting the tools to run at first, but I was able to use the shell to complete the tasks. One recurring problem was my use of tabs for indentation, which often triggered linter warnings. This highlighted how small formatting choices can cause issues with automated checks, even when the code runs correctly.</p>

											<p>This week was focused on finishing the project presentation. It was my first time using OBS and Resolve, and I found them interesting to work with. While the editing process was enjoyable, I found the voice recording more difficult. Presenting to nobody felt unnatural, and at one point I considered recording myself delivering it to a friend instead. Despite that, the task helped me build confidence with video tools and digital presentation.</p>

											<p>The final unit encouraged reflection on emerging trends in software engineering. It provided a good opportunity to review the whole module and recognise how my view of project management has changed and broadened over time. I have always felt that people management matters, especially when individuals are given ownership of their tasks. In my experience, this leads to better results and a stronger final product.</p>

									<h3>Synputer</h3>
									<p>EDC is commissioning a new computing system in partnership with Syn to bring a product to market by January 1984. Our team has been tasked with planning the development of this system based on an initial stakeholder discussion and supporting documents. The objective is to analyse stakeholder requirements, select a suitable development methodology and deliver a costed project plan with defined milestones, specifications and pricing, all within a fixed £500,000 budget.</p>

												<h3>Feedback</h3>
												<p>The group provided an excellent discussion of their approach/ methodology. It was a very good list of requirements with justifications. There was an excellent and well-structured list of gherkin statements.</p>
												<p>The group provided a very good plan and Gantt chart with a good explanation/ justification for costs. I would have liked to have seen the prototype dates made more explicit, though.</p>
												<p>There was a good explanation & illustration of build and test times.</p>
												<p>The submission was a very well-written, presented & structured report. There was good use of graphics and Gantt charts. It would have been nice to see some of the other standard tools being used as well.</p>
												<p>Overall, this was a very good submission that gave excellent explanations and used a number of standard tools.</p>

												<h3>Feedback</h3>
												<p>The student provided an excellent discussion of requirements with copious justifications - and a good adoption of a self-critical review - from the perspective of Synful</p>

												<p>The student also provided excellent costings & dual solutions. He used an innovative approach to develop a "new" board. My only comments would be - why not keep selling the tried & tested A83 board while there was a market - it could still bring in revenue? Also, I think the testing was somewhat underestimated - even if you allowed for some automated testing. </p>

												<p>It was an excellent presentation (and the first time I have had music :)) It was very clear and engaging with no obvious typos or stumbles</p>

												<p>Overall, it was an excellent design, structure & presentation with a good set of references.</p>

													<p>A very well-balanced e-portfolio. The reflection was good with some interesting insights and a plan that probably needs a little more detail to bring it to fruition. The evidence provided was copious, and the e-portfolio was well designed and easy to navigate. Overall, an excellent submission.</p>
